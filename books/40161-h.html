<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The writer of this volume has endeavoured to collect,
in a readable and attractive form, the best of
those medical Ana that have been preserved by tradition
or literature. In doing so, he has not only
done his best to combine and classify old stories, but
also cautiously to select his materials, so that his
work, while affording amusement to the leisure hours
of Doctors learned in their craft, might contain no
line that should render it unfit for the drawing-room
table. To effect this, it has been found necessary to
reject many valuable and characteristic anecdotes—some
of them entering too minutely into the mysteries
and technicalities of medicine and surgery, and some
being spiced with a humour ill calculated to please
the delicacy of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Much of the contents of this volume has never before
been published, but, after being drawn from a
variety of manuscript sources, is now for the first
time submitted to the world. It would be difficult to
enumerate all the persons to whom the writer is indebted
for access to documents, suggestions, critical
notes, or memoranda. He cannot, however, let the
present occasion go by without expressing his gratitude
to the College of Physicians, for the prompt urbanity
with which they allowed him to inspect the
treasures of their library. To Dr. Munk, the learned
librarian of the College—who for many years, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
scant leisure allowed him by the urgent demands of
an extensive practice, has found a dignified pastime
in antiquarian and biographic research—the writer's
best thanks are due. With a liberality by no means
always found in a student possessed of "special information,"
the Doctor surrendered his precious
stores to the use of a comparative stranger, apparently
without even thinking of the value of his gift.
But even more than to the librarian of the College
of Physicians the writer is indebted for assistance to
his very kind friend Dr. Diamond, of Twickenham
House—a gentleman who, to all the best qualities of
a complete physician, unites the graces of a scholarly
mind, an enthusiasm for art, and the fascinations of
a generous nature.</p>

<h2>A BOOK ABOUT DOCTORS</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;">
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT STICKS, AND RATHER LESS ABOUT
WIGS.</h3>


<p>Properly treated and fully expanded, this subject
of "the stick" would cover all the races
of man in all regions and all ages; indeed,
it would hide every member of the human family.
Attention could be called to the respect accorded
in every chapter of the world's history, sacred and
profane, to the <i>rabdos</i>—to the fasces of the Roman
lictors, which every school-boy honours (often unconsciously)
with an allusion when he says he will <i>lick</i>,
or vows he won't be <i>licked</i>,—to the herald's staff of
Hermes, the caduceus of Mercury, the wand of Æsculapius,
and the rods of Moses and the contending
sorcerers—to the mystic bundles of nine twigs, in
honour of the nine muses, that Dr. Busby loved to
wield, and which many a simple English parent believes
Solomon, in all his glory, recommended as an
element in domestic jurisdiction—to the sacred wands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of savage tribes, the staffs of our constables and
sheriffs, and the highly polished gold sticks and black
rods that hover about the anterooms of St. James's
or Portsoken. The rule of thumb has been said to be
the government of this world. And what is this
thumb but a short stick, a <i>sceptre</i>, emblematic of a
sovereign authority which none dares to dispute?
"The stick," says the Egyptian proverb, "came down
from heaven."</p>

<p>The only sticks, however, that we here care to
speak about are physicians' canes, barbers' poles, and
the twigs of rue which are still strewn before the prisoner
in the dock of a criminal court. Why should
they be thus strung together?</p>

<p>The physician's cane is a very ancient part of his
insignia. It is now disused, but up to very recent
times no doctor of medicine presumed to pay a professional
visit, or even to be seen in public, without
this mystic wand. Long as a footman's stick, smooth
and varnished, with a heavy gold knob or cross-bar at
the top, it was an instrument with which, down to the
present century, every prudent aspirant to medical
practice was provided. The celebrated "gold-headed
cane" which Radcliffe, Mead, Askew, Pitcairn and
Baillie successively bore is preserved in the College of
Physicians, bearing the arms which those gentlemen
assumed, or were entitled to. In one respect it deviated
from the physician's cane proper. It has a
cross-bar almost like a crook; whereas a physician's
wand ought to have a knob at the top. This knob in
olden times was hollow, and contained a vinaigrette,
which the man of science always held to his nose when
he approached a sick person, so that its fumes might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
protect him from the noxious exhalations of his patient.
We know timid people who, on the same plan,
have their handkerchiefs washed in camphor-water,
and bury their faces in them whenever they pass the
corner of a dingy street, or cross an open drain, or
come in contact with an ill-looking man. When Howard,
the philanthropist, visited Exeter, he found that
the medical officer of the county gaol had caused a
clause to be inserted in his agreement with the magistrates,
exonerating him from attendance and services
during any outbreak of the gaol fever. Most
likely this gentleman, by books or experience, had
been enlightened as to the inefficacy of the vinaigrette.</p>

<p>But though the doctor, like a soldier skulking from
the field of battle, might with impunity decline visiting
the wretched captives, the judge was forced to do
his part of the social duty to them—to sit in their
presence during their trial in a close, fetid court; to
brow-beat them when they presumed to make any
declaration of their innocence beyond a brief "not
guilty"; to read them an energetic homily on the consequences
of giving way to corrupt passions and evil
manners; and, finally, to order them their proper apportionments
of whipping, or incarceration, or banishment,
or death. Such was the abominable condition
of our prisons, that the poor creatures dragged
from them and placed in the dock often by the noxious
effluvia of their bodies made seasoned criminal
lawyers turn pale—partly, perhaps, through fear,
but chiefly through physical discomfort. Then arose
the custom of sprinkling aromatic herbs before the
prisoners—so that if the health of his Lordship and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the gentlemen of the long robe suffered from the
tainted atmosphere, at least their senses of smell
might be shocked as little as possible. Then, also,
came the chaplain's bouquet, with which that reverend
officer was always provided when accompanying
a criminal to Tyburn. Coke used to go circuit carrying
in his hand an enormous fan furnished with a
handle, in the shape of a goodly stick—the whole
forming a weapon of offence or defence. It is not
improbable that the shrewd lawyer caused the end of
this cumbrous instrument to be furnished with a
vinaigrette.</p>

<p>So much for the head of the physician's cane. The
stick itself was doubtless a relic of the conjuring paraphernalia
with which the healer, in ignorant and
superstitious times, worked upon the imagination of
the credulous. Just as the <b>R</b>[**symbol] which the doctor affixes
to his prescription is the old astrological sign (ill-drawn)
of Jupiter, so his cane descended to him from
Hermes and Mercurius. It was a relic of old jugglery,
and of yet older religion—one of those baubles which
we know well where to find, but which our conservative
tendencies disincline us to sweep away without
some grave necessity.</p>

<p>The charming-stick, the magic Æsculapian wand of
the Medicine-man, differed in shape and significance
from the pole of the barber-surgeon. In the "British
Apollo," 1703, No. 3, we read:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"I'd know why he that selleth ale<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs out a chequer'd part per pale:<br></span>
<span class="i0">And why a barber at port-hole<br></span>
<span class="i0">Puts forth a parti-coloured pole?"</span>
</div>

<p class="center">ANSWER.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"In ancient Rome, when men loved fighting,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And wounds and scars took much delight in,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Man-menders then had noble pay—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which we call surgeons to this day.<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas order'd that a huge long pole,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With basin deck'd, should grace the hole,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To guide the wounded, who unlopt<br></span>
<span class="i0">Could walk, on stumps the other hopt;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when they ended all their wars,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And men grew out of love with scars.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Their trade decaying, to keep swimming,<br></span>
<span class="i0">They joined the other trade of trimming;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And to their poles, to publish either,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus twisted both their trades together."</span>
</div>

<p>The principal objection that can be made to this
answer is that it leaves the question unanswered,
after making only a very lame attempt to answer it.
Lord Thurlow, in a speech delivered in the House of
Peers on 17th of July, 1797, opposing the surgeons'
incorporation bill, said that, "By a statute still in
force, the barbers and surgeons were each to use a
pole. The barbers were to have theirs blue and white,
striped with no other appendage; but the surgeons',
which was the same in other respects, was likewise to
have a gallipot and a red rag, to denote the particular
nature of their vocation."</p>

<p>But the reason why the surgeon's pole was adorned
with both blue and red seems to have escaped the
Chancellor. The chirurgical pole, properly tricked,
ought to have a line of blue paint, another of red, and
a third of white, winding round its length, in a regular
serpentine progression—the blue representing
the venous blood, the more brilliant colour the arterial,
and the white thread being symbolic of the bandage
used in tying up the arm after withdrawing the
ligature. The stick itself is a sign that the operator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
possesses a stout staff for his patients to hold, continually
tightening and relaxing their grasp during
the operation—accelerating the flow of the blood by
the muscular action of the arm. The phlebotomist's
staff is of great antiquity. It is to be found amongst
his properties, in an illuminated missal of the time of
Edward the First, and in an engraving of the
"Comenii Orbis Pictus."</p>

<p>Possibly in ancient times the physician's cane and
the surgeon's club were used more actively. For
many centuries fustigation was believed in as a sovereign
remedy for bodily ailment as well as moral
failings, and a beating was prescribed for an ague as
frequently as for picking and stealing. This process
Antonius Musa employed to cure Octavius Augustus
of Sciatica. Thomas Campanella believed that it had
the same effect as colocynth administered internally.
Galen recommended it as a means of fattening people.
Gordonius prescribed it in certain cases of nervous
irritability—"Si sit juvenis, et non vult obedire, flagelletur
frequenter et fortiter." In some rural districts
ignorant mothers still flog the feet of their children
to cure them of chilblains. And there remains
on record a case in which club-tincture produced excellent
results on a young patient to whom Desault
gave a liberal dose of it.</p>

<p>In 1792, when Sir Astley Cooper was in Paris, he
attended the lectures of Desault and Chopart in the
Hotel Dieu. On one occasion, during this part of
his student course, Cooper saw a young fellow, of
some sixteen years of age, brought before Desault
complaining of paralysis in his right arm. Suspecting
that the boy was only shamming, "Abraham,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Desault observed, unconcernedly, "Otez votre
chapeau."</p>

<p>Forgetting his paralytic story, the boy instantly
obeyed, and uncovered his head.</p>

<p>"Donnez moi un baton!" screamed Desault; and
he beat the boy unmercifully.</p>

<p>"D'ou venez vous?" inquired the operator when
the castigation was brought to a close.</p>

<p>"Faubourg de St. Antoine," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Oui, je le crois," replied Desault, with a shrug—speaking
a truth experience had taught him—"tous
les coquins viennent de ce quartier la."</p>

<p>But enough for the present of the barber-surgeon
and his pole. "Tollite barberum,"—as Bonnel
Thornton suggested, when in 1745 (a year barbarous
in more ways than one), the surgeons, on being disjoined
from the barbers, were asking what ought to
be their motto.</p>

<p>Next to his cane, the physician's wig was the most
important of his accoutrements. It gave profound
learning and wise thought to lads just out of their
teens. As the horse-hair skull-cap gives idle Mr.
Briefless all the acuteness and gravity of aspect which
one looks for in an attorney-general, so the doctor's
artificial locks were to him a crown of honour. One
of the Dukes of Holstein, in the eighteenth century,
just missed destruction through being warned not to
put on his head a poisoned wig which a traitorous
peruke-maker offered him. To test the value of the
advice given him, the Duke had the wig put upon the
head of its fabricator. Within twelve minutes the
man expired! We have never heard of a physician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
finding death in a wig; but a doctor who found the
means of life in one is no rare bird in history.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Each son of Sol, to make him look more big,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Had on a large, grave, decent, three-tailed wig;<br></span>
<span class="i0">His clothes full-trimmed, with button-holes behind,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Stiff were the skirts, with buckram stoutly lined;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The cloth-cut velvet, or more reverend black,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Full-made, and powder'd half-way down his back;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Large decent cuffs, which near the ground did reach,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With half a dozen buttons fix'd on each.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grave were their faces—fix'd in solemn state,<br></span>
<span class="i0">These men struck awe; their children carried weight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In reverend wigs old heads young shoulders bore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And twenty-five or thirty seemed threescore."</span>
</div>

<p>The three-tailed wig was the one worn by Will Atkins,
the gout doctor in Charles the Second's time
(a good specialty then!). Will Atkins lived in the
Old Bailey, and had a vast practice. His nostrums,
some of which were composed of <i>thirty</i> different ingredients,
were wonderful—but far less so than his
wig, which was combed and frizzled over each cheek.
When Will walked about the town, visiting his patients,
he sometimes carried a cane, but never wore a
hat. Such an article of costume would have disarranged
the beautiful locks, or, at least, have obscured
their glory.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Physic of old her entry made<br></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath th' immense full-bottom's shade;<br></span>
<span class="i0">While the gilt cane, with solemn pride,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To each sagacious nose applied,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seem'd but a necessary prop<br></span>
<span class="i0">To bear the weight of wig at top."</span>
</div>

<p>One of the most magnificent wigs on record was
that of Colonel Dalmahoy, which was celebrated in a
song beginning:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"If you would see a noble wig,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And in that wig a man look big,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Ludgate Hill repair, my joy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">And gaze on Col'nel Dalmahoy."</span>
</div>

<p>On Ludgate Hill, in close proximity to the Hall of
the Apothecaries in Water Lane, the Colonel vended
drugs and nostrums of all sorts—sweetmeats,
washes for the complexion, scented oil for the hair,
pomades, love-drops, and charms. Wadd, the humorous
collector of anecdotes relating to his profession,
records of him—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dalmahoy sold infusions and lotions,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Decoctions, and gargles, and pills;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Electuaries, powders, and potions,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Spermaceti, salts, scammony, squills.<br></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Horse-aloes, burnt alum, agaric,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Balm, benzoine, blood-stone, and dill;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Castor, camphor, and acid tartaric,<br></span>
<span class="i1">With specifics for every ill.<br></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But with all his specifics in store,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Death on Dalmahoy one day did pop;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And although he had doctors a score,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Made poor Dalmahoy shut up his shop."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last silk-coated physician was Henry Revell
Reynolds, M. D., one of the physicians who attended
George III. during his long and melancholy affliction.
Though this gentleman came quite down to living
times, he persisted to the end in wearing the costume—of
a well-powdered wig, silk coat, breeches, stockings,
buckled shoes, gold-headed cane, and lace ruffles—with
which he commenced his career. He was the
Brummel of the Faculty, and retained his fondness
for delicate apparel to the last. Even in his grave-clothes
the coxcombical tastes of the man exhibited
themselves. His very cerements were of "a good
make."</p>

<p>Whilst Brocklesby's wig is still bobbing about in
the distance, we may as well tell a good story of him.
He was an eccentric man, with many good points, one
of which was his friendship for Dr. Johnson. The
Duchess of Richmond requested Brocklesby to visit
her maid, who was so ill that she could not leave her
bed. The physician proceeded forthwith to Richmond
House, in obedience to the command. On arriving
there he was shown up-stairs by the invalid's
husband, who held the post of valet to the Duke. The
man was a very intelligent fellow, a character with
whom all visitors to Richmond House conversed
freely, and a vehement politician. In this last characteristic
the Doctor resembled him. Slowly the physician
and the valet ascended the staircase, discussing
the fate of parties, and the merits of ministers. They
became excited, and declaiming at the top of their
voices entered the sick room. The valet—forgetful
of his marital duties in the delights of an intellectual
contest—poured in a broadside of sarcasms, ironical
inquiries, and red-hot declamation; the doctor—with
true English pluck—returning fire, volley for volley.
The battle lasted for upwards of an hour, when the
two combatants walked down-stairs, and the man of
medicine took his departure. When the doctor arrived
at his door, and was stepping from his carriage,
it flashed across his mind that he had not applied his
finger to his patient's pulse, or even asked her how
she felt herself!</p>

<p>Previous to Charles II.'s reign physicians were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the habit of visiting their patients on horse-back, sitting
sideways on foot-cloths like women. Simeon Fox
and Dr. Argent were the last Presidents of the College
of Physicians to go their rounds in this undignified
manner. With the "Restoration" came the carriage
of the London physician. The <i>Lex Talionis</i>
says, "For there must now be a little coach and two
horses; and, being thus attended, half-a-piece, their
usual fee, is but ill-taken, and popped into their left
pocket, and possibly may cause the patient to send
for his worship twice before he will come again to
the hazard of another angel."</p>

<p>The fashion, once commenced, soon prevailed. In
Queen Anne's reign, no physician with the slightest
pretensions to practice could manage without his
chariot and four, sometimes even six, horses. In our
own day an equipage of some sort is considered so
necessary an appendage to a medical practitioner,
that a physician without a carriage (or a fly that can
pass muster for one) is looked on with suspicion. He
is marked down <i>mauvais sujet</i> in the same list with
clergymen without duty, barristers without chambers,
and gentlemen whose Irish tenantry obstinately refuse
to keep them supplied with money. On the
whole the carriage system is a good one. It protects
stair carpets from being soiled with muddy boots (a
great thing!), and bears cruelly on needy aspirants
after professional employment (a yet greater thing!
and one that manifestly ought to be the object of all
professional etiquette!). If the early struggles of
many fashionable physicians were fully and courageously
written, we should have some heart-rending
stories of the screwing and scraping and shifts by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
which their first equipages were maintained. Who
hasn't heard of the darling doctor who taught singing
under the moustachioed and bearded guise of an
Italian Count, at a young ladies' school at Clapham,
in order that he might make his daily West-end calls
between 3 p. m. and 6 p. m. in a well-built brougham
drawn by a fiery steed from a livery stable? There
was one noted case of a young physician who provided
himself with the means of figuring in a brougham
during the May-fair morning, by condescending
to the garb and duties of a flyman during the hours
of darkness. He used the same carriage at both
periods of the four-and-twenty hours, lolling in it by
daylight, and sitting on it by gaslight. The poor
fellow forgetting himself on one occasion, so far as
to jump <i>in</i> when he ought to have jumped <i>on</i>, or
jump <i>on</i> when he ought to have jumped <i>in</i>, he published
his delicate secret to an unkind world.</p>

<p>It is a rash thing for a young man to start his carriage,
unless he is sure of being able to sustain it for a
dozen years. To drop it is sure destruction. We remember
an ambitious Phaeton of Hospitals who astonished
the world—not only of his profession, but
of all London—with an equipage fit for an ambassador—the
vehicle and the steeds being obtained, like
the arms blazoned on his panels, upon credit. Six
years afterwards he was met by a friend crushing the
mud on the Marylebone pavements, and with a characteristic
assurance, that even adversity was unable
to deprive him of, said that his health was so much
deranged that his dear friend, Sir James Clarke, had
prescribed continual walking exercise for him as the
only means of recovering his powers of digestion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
His friends—good-natured people, as friends always
are—observed that "it was a pity Sir James hadn't
given him the advice a few years sooner—prevention
being better than cure."</p>

<p>Though physicians began generally to take to carriages
in Charles II.'s reign, it may not be supposed
that no doctor of medicine before that time experienced
the motion of a wheeled carriage. In "Stowe's
Survey of London" one may read:—</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the year 1563, Dr. Langton, a physician, rid in
a car, with a gown of damask, lined with velvet, and
a coat of velvet, and a cap of the same (such, it seems,
doctors then wore), but having a blue hood pinned
over his cap; which was (as it seems) a customary
mark of guilt. And so came through Cheapside on a
market-day."</p></blockquote>

<p>The doctor's offence was one against public morals.
He had loved not wisely—but too well. The same
generous weakness has brought learned doctors, since
Langton's day, into extremely ridiculous positions.</p>

<p>The cane, wig, silk coat, stockings, side-saddle, and
carriage, of the old physician have been mentioned.
We may not pass over his muff in silence. That he
might have his hands warm and delicate of touch,
and so be able to discriminate to a nicety the qualities
of his patient's arterial pulsations, he made his
rounds, in cold weather, holding before him a large
fur muff, in which his fingers and fore-arm were
concealed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>EARLY ENGLISH PHYSICIANS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"Medicine is a science which hath been, as we have said, more
professed than laboured, and yet more laboured than advanced;
the labour having been, in my judgment, rather in
circle than in progression. For I find much iteration, and
small progression."—Lord Bacon's <i>Advancement of Learning</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>The British doctor, however, does not make
his first appearance in sable dress and full-bottomed
wig. Chaucer's physician, who was "groundit
in Astronomy and Magyk Naturel," and whose
"study was but lytyl in the Bible," had a far smarter
and more attractive dress.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"In sanguyn and in perse he clad was al,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lined with taffata and with sendal."</span>
</div>

<p>Taffeta and silk, of crimson and sky-blue colour,
must have given an imposing appearance to this worthy
gentleman, who, resembling many later doctors
in his disuse of the Bible, resembled them also in his
love of fees.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"And yit he was but esy of dispence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He kepte that he won in pestelence;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For gold in physik is a cordial;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore he lovede gold in special."</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Amongst our more celebrated and learned English
physicians was John Phreas, born about the commencement
of the fifteenth century, and educated at
Oxford, where he obtained a fellowship on the foundation
of Balliol College. His M. D. degree he obtained
in Padua, and the large fortune he made by
the practice of physic was also acquired in Italy. He
was a poet and an accomplished scholar. Some of his
epistles in MS. are still preserved in the Balliol Library
and at the Bodleian. His translation of Diodorus
Siculus, dedicated to Paul II., procured for him
from that pontiff the fatal gift of an English bishopric.
A disappointed candidate for the same preferment
is said to have poisoned him before the day
appointed for his consecration.</p>

<p>Of Thomas Linacre, successively physician to
Henry VII., Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Princess
Mary, the memory is still green amongst men. At his
request, in conjunction with the representations of
John Chambre, Fernandus de Victoria, Nicholas
Halswell, John Fraunces, Robert Yaxley (physicians),
and Cardinal Wolsey, Henry VIII. granted
letters patent, establishing the College of Physicians,
and conferring on its members the sole privilege of
practicing, and admitting persons to practice, within
the city, and a circuit of seven miles. The college
also was empowered to license practitioners throughout
the kingdom, save such as were graduates of Oxford
and Cambridge—who were to be exempt from
the jurisdiction of the new college, save within London
and its precincts. Linacre was the first President
of the College of Physicians. The meetings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
learned corporation were held at Linacre's private
house, No. 5, Knight-Rider Street, Doctors' Commons.
This house (on which the Physician's arms,
granted by Christopher Barker, Garter King-at-arms,
Sept. 20, 1546, may still be seen,) was bequeathed to
the college by Linacre, and long remained their property
and abode. The original charter of the brotherhood
states: "Before this period a great multitude of
ignorant persons, of whom the greater part had no
insight into physic, nor into any other kind of learning—some
could not even read the letters and the
book—so far forth, that common artificers, as smiths,
weavers and women, boldly and accustomably took
upon them great cures, to the high displeasure of God,
great infamy of the Faculty, and the grievous hurt,
damage, and destruction of many of the king's liege
people."</p>

<p>Linacre died in the October of 1524. Caius, writing
his epitaph, concludes, "Fraudes dolosque mire
perosus, fidus amicis, omnibus juxta charus; aliquot
annos antequam obierat Presbyter factus; plenus
annes, ex hac vita migravit, multum desideratus."
His motive for taking holy orders towards the latter
part of his life is unknown. Possibly he imagined the
sacerdotal garb would be a secure and comfortable
clothing in the grave. Certainly he was not a profound
theologian. A short while before his death he
read the New Testament for the first time, when so
great was his astonishment at finding the rules of
Christians widely at variance with their practice,
that he threw the sacred volume from him in a passion,
and exclaimed, "Either this is not the gospel,
or we are not Christians."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>Of the generation next succeeding Linacre's was
John Kaye, or Key (or Caius, as it has been long pedantically
spelt). Like Linacre (the elegant writer
and intimate friend of Erasmus), Caius is associated
with letters not less than medicine. Born of a respectable
Norfolk family, Caius raised, on the foundation
of Gonvil Hall, the college in the University
of Cambridge that bears his name—to which Eastern
Counties' men do mostly resort. Those who know
Cambridge remember the quaint humour with which,
in obedience to the founder's will, the gates of Caius
are named. As a president of the College of Physicians,
Caius was a zealous defender of the rights of
his order. It has been suggested that Shakespeare's
Dr. Caius, in "The Merry Wives of Windsor," was
produced in resentment towards the president, for
his excessive fervor against the surgeons.</p>

<p>Caius terminated his laborious and honourable
career on July the 29th, 1573, in the sixty-third year
of his age.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/40161/40161-h/40161-h.htm#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He was buried in his college chapel, in
a tomb constructed some time before his decease, and
marked with the brief epitaph—"Fui Caius." In
the same year in which this physician of Edward VI.,
Mary, and Elizabeth died, was born Theodore Turquet
de Mayerne, Baron Aulbone of France, and Sir
Theodore Mayerne in England. Of Mayerne mention
will be made in various places of these pages. There
is some difficulty in ascertaining to how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
crowned heads this lucky courtier was appointed physician.
After leaving France and permanently fixing
himself in England, he kept up his connection with
the French, so that the list of his monarch-patients
may be said to comprise two French and three English
sovereigns—Henry IV. and Louis XIII. of
France, and James I., Charles I., and Charles II. of
England. Mayerne died at Chelsea, in the eighty-second
year of his age, on the 15th of March, 1655.
Like John Hunter, he was buried in the church of St.
Martin's-in-the-Fields. His library went to the College
of Physicians, and his wealth to his only daughter,
who was married to the Marquis of Montpouvillon.
Though Mayerne was the most eminent physician
of his time, his prescriptions show that his enlightenment
was not superior to the prevailing ignorance
of the period. He recommended a monthly
excess of wine and food as a fine stimulant to the system.
His treatise on Gout, written in French, and
translated into English (1676) by Charles II.'s physician
in ordinary, Dr. Thomas Sherley, recommends
a clumsy and inordinate administration of violent
drugs. Calomel he habitually administered in scruple
doses. Sugar of lead he mixed largely in his conserves;
pulverized human bones he was very fond of
prescribing; and the principal ingredient in his gout-powder
was "raspings of a human skull unburied."
But his sweetest compound was his "Balsam of
Bats," strongly recommended as an unguent for hypochondriacal
persons, into which entered adders,
bats, suckling whelps, earth-worms, hog's grease, the
marrow of a stag, and the thigh-bone of an ox. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
such a specimen of the doctor's skill, possibly the
reader will not care to study his receipts for canine
madness, communicated to the Royal Society in 1687,
or his "Excellent and well-approved Receipts and
Experiments in Cookery, with the best way of Preserving."
Nor will the reader be surprised to learn
that the great physician had a firm belief in the efficacy
of amulets and charms.</p>

<p>But the ignorance and superstition of which Mayerne
was the representative were approaching the
close of their career; and Sir Theodore's court celebrity
and splendour were to become contemptible by
the side of the scientific achievements of a contemporary.
The grave closed over Mayerne in 1655; but
in the December of 1652, the College of Physicians
had erected in their hall a statue of Harvey, who died
on the third of June, 1657, aged seventy-nine years.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The circling streams, once thought but pools of blood<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Whether life's fuel, or the body's food),<br></span>
<span class="i0">From dark oblivion Harvey's name shall save."</span>
</div>

<p>Aubrey says of Harvey—"He was not tall, but of
the lowest stature; round-faced, olivaster (waintscott)
complexion; little eie—round, very black, full
of spirit; his haire was black as a raven, but quite
white twenty years before he dyed. I remember he
was wont to drink coffee, which he and his brother
Eliab did, before coffee-houses were in fashion in
London. He was, as all the rest of his brothers, very
cholerique; and in his younger days wore a dagger
(as the fashion then was); but this doctor would be
apt to draw out his dagger upon every slight occasion.
He rode on <i>horse-back with a foot-cloath to visit</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<i>his patients, his man following on foot, as the fashion
then was, was very decent, now quite discontinued</i>."</p>

<p>Harvey's discovery dates a new era in medical and
surgical science. Its influence on scientific men, not
only as a stepping-stone to further discoveries, but
as a power rousing in all quarters a spirit of philosophic
investigation, was immediately perceptible. A
new class of students arose, before whom the foolish
dreams of medical superstition and the darkness of
empiricism slowly disappeared.</p>


<p>Of the physicians<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/40161/40161-h/40161-h.htm#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of what may be termed the
Elizabethan era, beyond all others the most sagacious
and interesting, is William Bulleyn. He belongs to
a bevy of distinguished Eastern Counties' physicians.
Dr. Butts, Henry VIII.'s physician, mentioned in
Strype's "Life of Cranmer," and made celebrated
amongst doctors by Shakespeare's "Henry the
Eighth," belonged to an honourable and gentle family
sprinkled over Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire.
The butcher king knighted him by the style of
William Butts of Norfolk. Caius was born at Norwich;
and the eccentric William Butler, of whom
Mayerne, Aubrey, and Fuller tell fantastic stories,
was born at Ipswich, about the year 1535.</p>

<p>William Bulleyn was born in the isle of Ely; but
it is with the eastern division of the county of Suffolk
that his name is especially associated. Sir William
Bulleyn, the Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the fifteenth year of Henry VII., and grandfather
of the unfortunate Anne Boleyn, was one of the magnates
of the doctor's family—members of which are
still to be found in Ipswich and other parts of East
Anglia, occupying positions of high respectability.
In the reigns of Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth, no
one ranked higher than William Bulleyn as botanist
and physician. The record of his acuteness and
learning is found in his numerous works, which are
amongst the most interesting prose writings of the
Elizabethan era. If Mr. Bohn, who has already done
so much to render old and neglected authors popular,
would present the public with a well-edited reprint
of Bulleyn's works, he would make a valuable addition
to the services he has already conferred on literature.</p>

<p>After receiving a preliminary education in the University
of Cambridge, Bulleyn enlarged his mind by
extended travel, spending much time in Germany and
Scotland. During the reign of Queen Mary he practiced
in Norwich; but he moved to Blaxhall, in Suffolk
(of which parish it is believed his brother was
for some years rector). Alluding to his wealthy
friend, Sir Thomas Rushe, of Oxford, he says, with
a pun, "I myself did know a Rushe, growing in the
fenne side, by Orford, in Suffolke, that might have
spent three hundred marks by year. Was not this a
<i>rush</i> of estimation? A fewe sutche rushes be better
than many great trees or bushes. But thou doste not
know that countrey, where sometyme I did dwell, at
a place called Blaxall, neere to that <i>Rushe Bushe</i>. I
would all rushes within this realme were as riche in
value." (The ancient family still maintain their connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
with the county.) Speaking of the rushes
near Orford, in Suffolk, and about the isle of Ely,
Bulleyn says, "The playne people make mattes and
horse-collars of the greater rushes, and of the smaller
they make lightes or candles for the winter. Rushes
that growe upon dry groundes be good to strewe in
halles, chambers, and galleries, to walk upon—defending
apparell, as traynes of gownes and kirtles,
from the dust."</p>

<p>He tells of the virtues of Suffolk sage (a herb that
the nurses of that county still believe in as having
miraculous effects, when administered in the form of
"sage-tea"). Of Suffolk hops (now but little grown
in the county) he mentions in terms of high praise—especially
of those grown round Framlingham Castle,
and "the late house of nunnes at Briziarde." "I
know in many places of the country of Suffolke,
where they brew theyr beere with hoppes that growe
upon theyr owne groundes, as in a place called Briziarde,
near an old famous castle called Framingham,
and in many other places of the country." Of the
peas of Orford the following mention is made:—"In
a place called Orforde, in Suffolke, betwene the haven
and the mayne sea, wheras never plow came, nor
natural earth was, but stones onely, infinite thousand
ships loden in that place, there did pease grow, whose
roots were more than iii fadome long, and the coddes
did grow uppon clusters like the keys of ashe trees,
bigger than fitches, and less than the fyeld peason,
very sweete to eat upon, and served many pore people
dwelling there at hand, which els should have perished
for honger, the scarcity of bread was so great.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
In so much that the playne pore people did make very
much of akornes; and a sickness of a strong fever did
sore molest the commons that yere, the like whereof
was never heard of there. Now, whether th' occasion
of these peason, in providence of God, came through
some shipwracke with much misery, or els by miracle,
I am not able to determine thereof; but sowen by
man's hand they were not, nor like other pease."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/40161/40161-h/40161-h.htm#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In the same way one has in the Doctor's "Book of
Simples" pleasant gossip about the more choice
productions of the garden and of commerce, showing
that horticulture must have been far more advanced
at that time than is generally supposed, and that the
luxuries imported from foreign countries were largely
consumed throughout the country. Pears, apples,
peaches, quinces, cherries, grapes, raisins, prunes,
barberries, oranges, medlars, raspberries and strawberries,
spinage, ginger, and lettuces are the good
things thrown upon the board.</p>

<p>Of pears, the author says: "There is a kynd of
peares growing in the city of Norwich, called the
black freere's peare, very delicious and pleasaunt,
and no lesse profitable unto a hoate stomacke, as I
heard it reported by a ryght worshipful phisicion of
the same city, called Doctour Manfield." Other pears,
too, are mentioned, "sutch as have names as peare
Robert, peare John, bishop's blessyngs, with other
prety names. The red warden is of greate vertue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
conserved, roasted or baken to quench choller." The
varieties of the apple especially mentioned are "the
costardes, the greene cotes, the pippen, the queene
aple."</p>

<p>Grapes are spoken of as cultivated and brought to
a high state of perfection in Suffolk and other parts
of the country. Hemp is humorously called "gallow
grasse or neckweede." The heartesease, or paunsie, is
mentioned by its quaint old name, "three faces in one
hodde." Parsnips, radishes, and carrots are offered
for sale. In the neighborhood of London, large
quantities of these vegetables were grown for the
London market; but Bulleyn thinks little of them,
describing them as "more plentiful than profytable."
Of figs—"Figges be good agaynst melancholy, and
the falling evil, to be eaten. Figges, nuts, and herb
grace do make a sufficient medicine against poison or
the pestilence. Figges make a good gargarism to
cleanse the throates."</p>

<p>The double daisy is mentioned as growing in
gardens. Daisy tea was employed in gout and rheumatism—as
herb tea of various sorts still is by the
poor of our provinces. With daisy tea (or <i>bellis-tea</i>)
"I, Bulleyn, did recover one Belliser, not onely from
a spice of the palsie, but also from the quartan. And
afterwards, the same Belliser, more unnatural than a
viper, sought divers ways to have murthered me, taking
part against me with my mortal enemies, accompanied
with bloudy ruffins for that bloudy purpose."
Parsley, also, was much used in medicine. And as it
was the custom for the doctor to grow his own herbs
in his garden, we may here see the origin of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
nursery tradition of little babies being brought by
the doctor from the parsley bed.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/40161/40161-h/40161-h.htm#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Scarcely less interesting than "The Book of Simples"
is Bulleyn's "Dialogue betweene Soarenes and
Chirurgi." It opens with an honourable mention of
many distinguished physicians and chirurgians. Dr.
John Kaius is praised as a worthy follower of Linacre.
Dr. Turner's "booke of herbes will always
grow greene." Sir Thomas Eliot's "'castel of
health' cannot decay." Thomas Faire "is not deade,
but is transformed and chaunged into a new nature
immortal." Androwe Borde, the father of "Merry
Andrews," "wrote also wel of physicke to profit the
common wealth withal." Thomas Pannel, the translator
of the Schola Saternitana, "hath play'd ye
good servant to the commonwealth in translating
good bookes of physicke." Dr. William Kunyngham
"hath wel travailed like a good souldiour agaynst the
ignorant enemy." Numerous other less eminent
practitioners are mentioned—such as Buns, Edwards,
Hatcher, Frere, Langton, Lorkin, Wendy—educated
at Cambridge; Gee and Simon Ludford, of Oxford;
Huyck (the Queen's physician), Bartley, Carr; Masters,
John Porter, of Norwich; Edmunds of York,
Robert Baltrop, and Thomas Calfe, apothecary.</p>

<p>"Soft chirurgians," says Bulleyn, "make foul
sores." He was a bold and courageous one. "Where
the wound is," runs the Philippine proverb, "the
plaster must be." Bulleyn was of the same opinion;
but, in dressing a tender part, the surgeon is directed
to have "a gladsome countenance," because "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
paciente should not be greatly troubled." For bad
surgeons he has not less hostility than he has for</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i2">"Petty Foggers, in cases of the law,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who make mountaynes of molhils, and trees of a straw."</span>
</div>

<p>The state of medicine in Elizabeth's reign may be
discovered by a survey of the best recipes of this
physician, who, in sagacity and learning, was far
superior to Sir Theodore Mayerne, his successor by a
long interval.</p>

<p>"<i>An Embrocation.</i>—An embrocation is made after
this manner:—<b>&#8478;</b>. Of a decoction of mallowes, vyolets,
barly, quince seed, lettice leaves, one pint; of barly
meale, two ounces; of oyle of vyolets and roses, of
each, an ounce and half; of butter, one ounce; and
then seeth them all together till they be like a broathe,
puttyng thereto, at the ende, four yolkes of eggs;
and the maner of applying them is with peeces of
cloth, dipped in the aforesaid decoction, being
actually hoate."</p>

<p>"<i>A Good Emplaster.</i>—You shall mak a plaster with
these medicines following, which the great learned
men themselves have used unto their pacientes:—<b>&#8478;</b>.
Of hulled beanes, or beane flower that is without the
brane, one pound; of mallow-leaves, two handfuls;
seethe them in lye, til they be well sodden, and afterwarde
let them be stamped and incorporate with four
ounces of meale of lint or flaxe, two ounces of meale
of lupina; and forme thereof a plaster with goat's
grease, for this openeth the pores, avoideth the matter,
and comforteth also the member; but if the place,
after a daye or two of the application, fall more and

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>Pearl electuaries and pearl mixtures were very
fashionable medicines with the wealthy down to the
commencement of the eighteenth century. Here we
have Bulleyn's recipe for</p>

<p>"<i>Electuarium de Gemmis.</i>—Take two drachms of
white perles; two little peeces of saphyre; jacinth,
corneline, emerauldes, granettes, of each an ounce;
setwal, the sweate roote doronike, the rind of pomecitron,
mace, basel seede, of each two drachms; of
redde corall, amber, shaving of ivory, of each two
drachms; rootes both of white and red behen, ginger,
long peper, spicknard, folium indicum, saffron,
cardamon, of each one drachm; of troch, diarodon,
lignum aloes, of each half a small handful; cinnamon,
galinga, zurubeth, which is a kind of setwal, of each
one drachm and a half; thin pieces of gold and sylver,
of each half a scruple; of musk, half a drachm. Make
your electuary with honey emblici, which is the fourth
kind of mirobalans with roses, strained in equall
partes, as much as will suffice. This healeth cold diseases
of ye braine, harte, stomack. It is a medicine
proved against the tremblynge of the harte, faynting
and souning, the weaknes of the stomacke, pensivenes,
solitarines. Kings and noble men have used this for
their comfort. It causeth them to be bold-spirited,
the body to smell wel, and ingendreth to the face good
coloure."</p>

<p>Truly a medicine for kings and noblemen! During
the railway panic in '46 an unfortunate physician
prescribed for a nervous lady:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0"><b>&#8478;</b>. Great Western, 350 shares.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Eastern Counties&nbsp;}<br></span>
<span class="i0">North Middlesex } a—a 1050<br></span>
<span class="i0">Mft. Haust. 1. Om. noc. cap.<br></span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>This direction to a delicate gentlewoman, to swallow
nightly two thousand four hundred and fifty railway
shares, was regarded as evidence of the physician's
insanity, and the management of his private
affairs was forthwith taken out of his hands. But
assuredly it was as rational a prescription as Bulleyn's
"Electuarium de Gemmis."</p>

<p>"<i>A Precious Water.</i>—Take nutmegges, the roote
called doronike, which the apothecaries have, setwall,
gatangall, mastike, long peper, the bark of pomecitron,
of mellon, sage, bazel, marjorum, dill, spiknard,
wood of aloes, cubebe, cardamon, called graynes of
paradise, lavender, peniroyall, mintes, sweet catamus,
germander, enulacampana, rosemary, stichados, and
quinance, of eche lyke quantity; saffron, an ounce
and half; the bone of a harte's heart grated, cut, and
stamped; and beate your spyces grossly in a morter.
Put in ambergrice and musk, of each half a drachm.
Distil this in a simple aqua vitæ, made with strong
ale, or sackeleyes and aniseedes, not in a common
styll, but in a serpentine; to tell the vertue of this
water against colde, phlegme, dropsy, heavines of
minde, comming of melancholy, I cannot well at thys
present, the excellent virtues thereof are sutch, and
also the tyme were to long."</p>

<p>The cure of cancers has been pretended and attempted
by a numerous train of knaves and simpletons,
as well as men of science. In the Elizabethan
time this most terrible of maladies was thought to be
influenced by certain precious waters—<i>i. e.</i> precious
messes.</p>

<p>"Many good men and women," says Bulleyn,
"wythin thys realme have dyvers and sundry medicines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
for the canker, and do help their neighboures
that bee in perill and daunger whyche be not onely
poore and needy, having no money to spende in chirurgie.
But some do well where no chirurgians be
neere at hand; in such cases, as I have said, many
good gentlemen and ladyes have done no small pleasure
to poore people; as that excellent knyght, and
worthy learned man, Syr Thomas Eliot, whose works
be immortall. Syr William Parris, of Cambridgeshire,
whose cures deserve prayse; Syr William Gascoigne,
of Yorkshire, that helped many soare eyen;
and the Lady Tailor, of Huntingdonshire, and the
Lady Darrell of Kent, had many precious medicines
to comfort the sight, and to heale woundes withal,
and were well seene in herbes.</p>

<p>"The commonwealth hath great want of them, and
of theyr medicines, whych if they had come into my
handes, they should have bin written in my booke.
Among al other there was a knight, a man of great
worshyp, a Godly hurtlesse gentleman, which is departed
thys lyfe, hys name is Syr Anthony Heveningham.
This gentleman learned a water to kyll a
canker of hys owne mother, whych he used all hys
lyfe, to the greate helpe of many men, women, and
chyldren."</p>

<p>This water "learned by Syr Anthony Heveningham"
was, Bulleyn states on report, composed
thus:—</p>

<p>"<i>Precious Water to Cure a Canker</i>:—Take dove's
foote, a herbe so named, Arkangell ivy wyth the berries,
young red bryer toppes, and leaves, whyte roses,
theyr leaves and buds, red sage, selandyne, and woodbynde,
of eche lyke quantity, cut or chopped and put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
into pure cleane whyte wyne, and clarified hony.
Then breake into it alum glasse and put in a little
of the pouder of aloes hepatica. Destill these together
softly in a limbecke of glasse or pure tin; if not,
then in limbecke wherein aqua vitæ is made. Keep
this water close. It will not onely kyll the canker,
if it be duly washed therewyth; but also two droppes
dayly put into the eye wyll sharp the syght, and
breake the pearle and spottes, specially if it be
dropped in with a little fenell water, and close the
eys after."</p>

<p>There is reason to wish that all empirical applications,
for the cure of cancer, were as harmless as this.</p>

<p>The following prescription for pomatum differs but
little from the common domestic receipts for lip-salve
in use at the present day:—</p>

<p>"<i>Sickness.</i>—How make you pomatum?</p>

<p>"<i>Health.</i>—Take the fat of a young kyd one pound,
temper it with the water of musk roses by the space
of foure dayes; then take five apples, and dresse them,
and cut them in pieces, and lard them with cloves,
then boyle them altogeather in the same water of
roses, in one vessel of glasse; set within another vessel;
let it boyle on the fyre so long until all be white;
then wash them with ye same water of muske roses;
this done, kepe it in a glass; and if you wil have it
to smel better, then you must put in a little civet or
musk, or of them both, and ambergrice. Gentilwomen
doe use this to make theyr faces smoth and fayre, for
it healeth cliftes in the lyppes, or in any other place
of the hands and face."</p>

<p>The most laughable of all Bulleyn's receipts is one
in which, for the cure of a child suffering under a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
certain nervous malady, he prescribes "a smal yong
mouse rosted." To some a "rosted mouse" may
seem more palatable than the compound in which
snails are the principal ingredient. "Snayles," says
Bulleyn, "broken from the shelles and sodden in
whyte wyne with oyle and sugar are very holsome,
because they be hoat and moist for the straightnes of
the lungs and cold cough. Snails stamped with camphory,
and leven wil draw forth prycks in the flesh."
So long did this belief in the virtue of snails retain
its hold on Suffolk, that the writer of these pages remembers
a venerable lady (whose memory is cherished
for her unostentatious benevolence and rare
worth) who for years daily took a cup of snail broth,
for the benefit of a weak chest.</p>

<p>One minor feature of Bulleyn's works is the number
of receipts given in them for curing the bites of
mad dogs. The good man's horror of Suffolk witches
is equal to his admiration of Suffolk dairies. Of the
former he says, "I dyd know wythin these few yeres
a false witch, called M. Line, in a towne of Suffolke
called Derham, which with a payre of ebene beades,
and certain charmes, had no small resort of foolysh
women, when theyr chyldren were syck. To thys
lame wytch they resorted, to have the fairie charmed
and the spyrite conjured away; through the prayers
of the ebene beades, whych she said came from the
Holy Land, and were sanctifyed at Rome. Through
whom many goodly cures were don, but my chaunce
was to burn ye said beades. Oh that damnable
witches be suffred to live unpunished and so many
blessed men burned; witches be more hurtful in this
realm than either quarten or pestilence. I know in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
a towne called Kelshall in Suffolke, a witch, whose
name was M. Didge, who with certain <i>Ave Marias</i>
upon her ebene beades, and a waxe candle, used this
charme for S. Anthonies fyre, having the sycke body
before her, holding up her hande, saying—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">'There came two angels out of the North-east,<br></span>
<span class="i0">One brought fyre, the other brought frost,—<br></span>
<span class="i2">Out fyre, and in frost!'</span>
</div>

<p>"I could reherse an hundred of sutch knackes, of these
holy gossips. The fyre take them all, for they be
God's enemyes."</p>

<p>On leaving Blaxhall in Suffolk, Bulleyn migrated
to the north. For many years he practised with success
at Durham. At Shields he owned a considerable
property. Sir Thomas, Baron of Hilton, Commander
of Tinmouth Castle under Philip and Mary, was his
patron and intimate friend. His first book, entitled
"Government of Health," he dedicated to Sir Thomas
Hilton; but the MS., unfortunately, was lost in a shipwreck
before it was printed. Disheartened by this
loss, and the death of his patron, Bulleyn bravely set
to work in London, to "revive his dead book."
Whilst engaged on the laborious work of recomposition,
he was arraigned on a grave charge of murder.
"One William Hilton," he says, telling his own story,
"brother to the sayd Syr Thomas Hilton, accused me
of no less cryme then of most cruel murder of his
owne brother, who dyed of a fever (sent onely of
God) among his owne frends, fynishing his lyfe in
the Christian fayth. But this William Hilton caused
me to be arraigned before that noble Prince, the
Duke's Grace of Norfolke, for the same; to this end to
have had me dyed shamefully; that with the covetous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Ahab he might have, through false witnes and perjury,
obtayned by the counsel of Jezabell, a wineyard,
by the pryce of blood. But it is wrytten, <i>Testis
mendax peribit</i>, a fals witnes shal com to naught;
his wicked practise was wisely espyed, his folly deryded,
his bloudy purpose letted, and fynallye I was
with justice delivered."</p>

<p>This occurred in 1560. His foiled enemy afterwards
endeavoured to get him assassinated; but he
again triumphed over the machinations of his adversary.
Settling in London, he obtained a large practice,
though he was never enrolled amongst the physicians
of the college. His leisure time he devoted to
the composition of his excellent works. To the last
he seems to have kept up a close connection with the
leading Eastern Counties families. His "Comfortable
Regiment and Very Wholsome order against the
moste perilous Pleurisie," was dedicated to the Right
Worshipful Sir Robart Wingfelde of Lethryngham,
Knight.</p>

<p>William Bulleyn died in London, on the 7th of
January, 1576, and was buried in the church of St.
Giles's, Cripplegate, in the same tomb wherein his
brother Richard had been laid thirteen years before;
and wherein John Fox, the martyrologist, was interred
eleven years later.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>SIR THOMAS BROWNE AND SIR KENELM DIGBY.</h3>


<p>Amongst the physicians of the seventeenth century
were three Brownes—father, son, and grandson. The
father wrote the "Religio Medici," and the "Pseudoxia
Epidemica"—a treatise on vulgar errors. The
son was the traveller, and author of "Travels in Hungaria,
Servia, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Thessaly, Austria,
Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Friuli &amp;c.," and the
translator of the Life of Themistocles in the English
version of "Plutarch's Lives" undertaken by Dryden.
He was also a physician of Bartholomew's, and a
favourite physician of Charles II., who on one occasion
said of him, "Doctor Browne is as learned as
any of the college, and as well bred as any of the
court." The grandson was a Fellow of the Royal
Society, and, like his father and grandfather, a Fellow
of the Royal College of Physicians; but he was
by no means worthy of his distinguished progenitors.
Alike unknown in literature, science, and art, he was
a miserable sot, and was killed by a fall from his
horse, between Southfleet and Gravesend, when in a
state of intoxication. He was thus cut off in the July<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
of 1710, having survived his father not quite two
years.</p>

<p>The author of the "Religio Medici" enjoys as good
a chance of an immortality of fame as any of his
contemporaries. The child of a London merchant,
who left him a comfortable fortune, Thomas Browne
was from the beginning of his life (Oct. 19, 1605) to
its close (Oct. 19, 1682), well placed amongst the
wealthier of those who occupied the middle way of
life. From Winchester College, where his schoolboy
days were spent, he proceeded to the University of
Oxford, becoming a member of Broadgates Hall, i.e.,
Pembroke College—the college of Blackstone, Shenstone,
and Samuel Johnson. After taking his B.A.
and M.A. degrees, he turned his attention to medicine,
and for some time practised as a physician in
Oxfordshire. Subsequently to this he travelled over
different parts of Europe, visiting France, Italy, and
Holland, and taking a degree of Doctor in Physic at
Leyden. Returning to England, he settled at Norwich,
married a rich and beautiful Norfolk lady,
named Mileham; and for the rest of his days resided
in that ancient city, industriously occupied with an
extensive practice, the pursuits of literature, and the
education of his children. When Charles II. visited
Norwich in 1671, Thomas Browne, M.D., was
knighted by the royal hand. This honour, little as a
man of letters would now esteem it, was highly prized
by the philosopher. He thus alludes to it in his "Antiquities
of Norwich"—"And it is not for some wonder,
that Norwich having been for so long a time so
considerable a place, so few kings have visited it; of
which number among so many monarchs since the Conquest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
we find but four; viz., King Henry III., Edward
I., Queen Elizabeth, and our gracious sovereign
now reigning, King Charles II., of which I had a
particular reason to take notice."</p>

<p>Amongst the Norfolk people Sir Thomas was very
popular, his suave and unobtrusive manners securing
him many friends, and his philosophic moderation of
temper saving him from ever making an enemy.
The honour conferred on him was a subject of congratulation—even
amongst his personal friends,
when his back was turned. The Rev. John Whitefoot,
M.A., Rector of Heigham, in Norfolk, in his
"Minutes for the Life of Sir Thomas Browne," says,
that had it been his province to preach his funeral
sermon, he should have taken his text from an uncanonical
book—"I mean that of Syracides, or Jesus,
the son of Syrach, commonly called Ecclesiasticus,
which, in the 38th chapter, and the first verse, hath
these words, 'Honour a physician with the honour
due unto him; for the uses which you may have of
him, for the Lord hath created him; for of the Most
High cometh healing, and he shall receive Honour
of the King' (as ours did that of knighthood from
the present King, when he was in this city). 'The
skill of the physician shall lift up his head, and in
the sight of great men shall he be in admiration'; so
was this worthy person by the greatest man of this
nation that ever came into this country, by whom also
he was frequently and personally visited."</p>

<p>Widely and accurately read in ancient and modern
literature, and possessed of numerous accomplishments,
Sir Thomas Browne was in society diffident
almost to shyness. "His modesty," says Whitefoot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
"was visible in a natural habitual blush, which was
increased upon the least occasion, and oft discovered
without any observable cause. Those who knew him
only by the briskness of his writings were astonished
at his gravity of aspect and countenance, and freedom
from loquacity." As was his manner, so was
his dress. "In his habit of cloathing he had an aversion
to all finery, and affected plainness both in fashion
and ornaments."</p>

<p>The monuments of Sir Thomas and his lady are in
the church of St. Peter's, Mancroft, Norwich, where
they were buried. Some years since Sir Thomas
Browne's tomb was opened for the purpose of submitting
it to repair, when there was discovered on
his coffin a plate, of which Dr. Diamond, who happened
at the time to be in Norwich, took two rubbings,
one of which is at present in the writer's custody.
It bears the following interesting inscription:—"Amplissimus
vir Dr. Thomas Browne Miles
Medicinæ Dr. Annos Natus et Denatus 19 Die Mensis
Anno Dmi., 1682—hoc loculo indormiens corporis
spagyrici pulvere plumbum in aurum convertit."</p>

<p>The "Religio Medici" not only created an unprecedented
sensation by its erudition and polished
style, but it shocked the nervous guardians of orthodoxy
by its boldness of inquiry. It was assailed for
its infidelity and scientific heresies. According to
Coleridge's view of the "Religio Medici," Sir Thomas
Browne, "a fine mixture of humourist, genius, and
pedant," was a Spinosist without knowing it. "Had
he," says the poet, "lived nowadays, he would probably
have been a very ingenious and bold infidel in
his real opinions, though the kindness of his nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
would have kept him aloof from vulgar, prating, obtrusive
infidelity."</p>

<p>Amongst the adverse critics of the "Religio Medici"
was the eccentric, gallant, brave, credulous, persevering,
frivolous, Sir Kenelm Digby. A Mæcenas,
a Sir Philip Sydney, a Dr. Dee, a Beau Fielding, and
a Dr. Kitchener, all in one, this man is chief of those
extravagant characters that astonish the world at
rare intervals, and are found nowhere except in actual
life. No novelist of the most advanced section
of the idealistic school would dare to create such a
personage as Sir Kenelm. The eldest son of the ill-fated
Sir Everard Digby, he was scarcely three years
old when his father atoned on the scaffold for his
share in the gunpowder treason. Fortunately a portion
of the family estate was entailed, so Sir Kenelm,
although the offspring of attainted blood, succeeded
to an ample revenue of about £3000 a-year. In 1618
(when only in his fifteenth year) he entered Gloucester
Hall, now Worcester College, Oxford. In 1621
he commenced foreign travel. He attended Charles
I. (then Prince of Wales) at the Court of Madrid;
and returning to England in 1623, was knighted by
James I. at Hinchinbroke, the house of Lord Montague,
on the 23rd of October in that year. From
that period he was before the world as courtier, cook,
lover, warrior, alchemist, political intriguer, and man
of letters. He became a gentleman of the bedchamber,
and commissioner of the navy. In 1628 he obtained
a naval command, and made his brilliant expedition
against the Venetians and Algerians, whose
galleys he routed off Scanderon. This achievement
is celebrated by his client and friend, Ben Jonson:—</p>

<div class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Though, happy Muse, thou know my Digby well,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet read in him these lines: he doth excel<br></span>
<span class="i0">In honour, courtesy, and all the parts<br></span>
<span class="i0">Court can call hero, or man could call his arts.<br></span>
<span class="i0">He's prudent, valiant, just, and temperate;<br></span>
<span class="i0">In him all virtue is beheld in state;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And he is built like some imperial room<br></span>
<span class="i0">For that to dwell in, and be still at home.<br></span>
<span class="i0">His breast is a brave palace, a broad street,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where all heroic, ample thoughts do meet;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where nature such a large survey hath ta'en,<br></span>
<span class="i0">As other souls, to his, dwelt in a lane:<br></span>
<span class="i0">Witness his action done at Scanderoon<br></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his birthday, the eleventh of June."</span>
</div>

<p>Returning from war, he became once more the student,
presenting in 1632 the library he had purchased
of his friend Allen, to the Bodleian Library, and devoting
his powers to the mastery of controversial
divinity. Having in 1636 entered the Church of
Rome, he resided for some time abroad. Amongst
his works at this period were his "Conference with a
Lady about the Choice of Religion," published in
1638, and his "Letters between Lord George Digby
and Sir Kenelm Digby, Knt., concerning Religion,"
not published till 1651. It is difficult to say to which
he was most devoted—his King, his Church, literature,
or his beautiful and frail wife, Venetia Stanley,
whose charms fascinated the many admirers on whom
she distributed her favours, and gained her Sir
Kenelm for a husband when she was the discarded
mistress of Richard, Earl of Dorset. She had borne
the Earl children, so his Lordship on parting settled
on her an annuity of £500 per annum. After her
marriage, this annuity not being punctually paid,
Sir Kenelm sued the Earl for it. Well might Mr.
Lodge say, "By the frailties of that lady much of the
noblest blood of England was dishonoured, for she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was the daughter of Sir Edward Stanley, Knight of
the Bath, grandson of the great Edward, Earl of
Derby, by Lucy, daughter and co-heir of Thomas
Percy, Earl of Northumberland." Such was her
unfair fame. "The <i>fair fame</i> left to Posterity of
that Truly Noble Lady, the Lady Venetia Digby, late
wife of Sir Kenelm Digby, Knight, a Gentleman Absolute
in all Numbers," is embalmed in the clear
verses of Jonson. Like Helen, she is preserved to us
by the sacred poet.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Draw first a cloud, all save her neck,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And out of that make day to break;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Till like her face it do appear,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And men may think all light rose there."</span>
</div>

<p>In other and more passionate terms Sir Kenelm
painted the same charms in his "Private Memoirs."</p>

<p>But if Sir Kenelm was a chivalric husband, he was
not a less loyal subject. How he avenged in France
the honour of his King, on the body of a French nobleman,
may be learnt in a curious tract, "Sir Kenelme
Digby's Honour Maintained. By a most courageous
combat which he fought with Lord Mount le
Ros, who by base and slanderous words reviled our
King. Also the true relation how he went to the
King of France, who kindly intreated him, and sent
two hundred men to guard him so far as Flanders.
And now he is returned from Banishment, and to
his eternall honour lives in England."</p>

<p>Sir Kenelm's "Observations upon Religio Medici,"
are properly characterized by Coleridge as those of
a pedant. They were written whilst he was kept a
prisoner, by order of the Parliament, in Winchester
House; and the author had the ludicrous folly to
assert that he both read the "Religio Medici"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
through for the first time, and wrote his bulky criticism
upon it, in less than twenty-four hours. Of all
the claims that have been advanced by authors for
the reputation of being rapid workmen, this is perhaps
the most audacious. For not only was the task
one that at least would require a month, but the impudent
assertion that it was accomplished in less than
a day and night was contradicted by the title-page,
in which "the observations" are described as "occasionally
written." Beckford's vanity induced him
to boast that "Vathek" was composed at one sitting
of two days and three nights; but this statement—outrageous
falsehood though it be—was sober truth
compared with Sir Kenelm's brag.</p>

<p>But of all Sir Kenelm's vagaries, his Sympathetic
Powder was the drollest. The composition, revealed
after the Knight's death by his chemist and steward,
George Hartman, was effected in the following manner:—English
vitriol was dissolved in warm water;
this solution was filtered, and then evaporated till a
thin scum appeared on the surface. It was then left
undisturbed and closely covered in a cool place for
two or three days, when fair, green, and large crystals
were evolved. "Spread these crystals," continues
the chemist, "abroad in a large flat earthen dish,
and expose them to the heat of the sun in the dog-days,
turning them often, and the sun will calcine
them white; when you see them all white without,
beat them grossly, and expose them again to the sun,
securing them from the rain; when they are well calcined,
powder them finely, and expose this powder
again to the sun, turning and stirring it often. Continue
this until it be reduced to a white powder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
which put up in a glass, and tye it up close, and
keep it in a dry place."</p>

<p>The virtues of this powder were unfolded by Sir
Kenelm, in a French oration delivered to "a solemn
assembly of Nobles and Learned Men at Montpellier,
in France." It cured wounds in the following manner:—If
any piece of a wounded person's apparel,
having on it the stain of blood that had proceeded
from the wound, was dipped in water holding in solution
some of this sympathetic powder, the wound
of the injured person would forthwith commence a
healing process. It mattered not how far distant the
sufferer was from the scene of operation. Sir Kenelm
gravely related the case of his friend Mr. James
Howel, the author of the "Dendrologia," translated
into French by Mons. Baudoin. Coming accidentally
on two of his friends whilst they were fighting
a duel with swords, Howel endeavoured to separate
them by grasping hold of their weapons. The result
of this interference was to show the perils that</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i10">"Environ<br></span>
<span class="i0">The man who meddles with cold iron."</span>
</div>

<p>His hands were severely cut, insomuch that some four
or five days afterwards, when he called on Sir Kenelm,
with his wounds plastered and bandaged up, he
said his surgeons feared the supervention of gangrene.
At Sir Kenelm's request, he gave the knight
a garter which was stained with his blood. Sir
Kenelm took it, and without saying what he was about
to do, dipped it in a solution of his powder of vitriol.
Instantly the sufferer started.</p>

<p>"What ails you?" cried Sir Kenelm.</p>

<p>"I know not what ails me," was the answer; "but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
I find that I feel no more pain. Methinks that a
pleasing kind of freshnesse, as it were a cold napkin,
did spread over my hand, which hath taken away
the inflammation that tormented me before."</p>

<p>"Since that you feel," rejoined Sir Kenelm, "already
so good an effect of my medicament, I advise
you to cast away all your plaisters. Only keep the
wound clean, and in moderate temper 'twixt heat
and cold."</p>

<p>Mr. Howel went away, sounding the praises of his
physician; and the Duke of Buckingham, hearing
what had taken place, hastened to Sir Kenelm's house
to talk about it. The Duke and Knight dined together;
when, after dinner, the latter, to show his guest
the wondrous power of his powder, took the garter
out of the solution, and dried it before the fire.
Scarcely was it dry, when Mr. Howel's servant ran
in to say that his master's hand was worse than ever—burning
hot, as if "it were betwixt coales of fire."
The messenger was dismissed with the assurance that
ere he reached home his master would be comfortable
again. On the man retiring, Sir Kenelm put the
garter back into the solution—the result of which
was instant relief to Mr. Howel. In six days the
wounds were entirely healed. This remarkable case
occurred in London, during the reign of James the
First. "King James," says Sir Kenelm, "required a
punctuall information of what had passed touching
this cure; and, after it was done and perfected, his
Majesty would needs know of me how it was done—having
drolled with me first (which he could do with
a very good grace) about a magician and sorcerer."
On the promise of inviolable secrecy, Sir Kenelm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
communicated the secret to his Majesty; "whereupon
his Majesty made sundry proofs, whence he received
singular satisfaction."</p>

<p>The secret was also communicated by Sir Kenelm
to Mayerne, through whom it was imparted to the
Duke of Mayerne—"a long time his friend and protector."
After the Duke's death, his surgeon communicated
it to divers people of quality; so that, ere
long, every country-barber was familiar with the discovery.
The mention made of Mayerne in the lecture
is interesting, as it settles a point on which Dr. Aikin
had no information; viz.,—Whether Sir Theodore's
Barony of Aubonne was hereditary or acquired? Sir
Kenelm says, "A little while after the Doctor went to
France, to see some fair territories that he had purchased
near Geneva, which was the Barony of Aubonne."</p>

<p>For a time the Sympathetic Powder was very generally
believed in; and it doubtless did as much good
as harm, by inducing people to throw from their
wounds the abominable messes of grease and irritants
which were then honoured with the name of plaisters.
"What is this?" asked Abernethy, when about to
examine a patient with a pulsating tumour, that was
pretty clearly an aneurism.</p>

<p>"Oh! that is a plaister," said the family doctor.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Abernethy, taking it off, and pitching
it aside.</p>

<p>"That was all very well," said the physician, on
describing the occurrence; "but that 'pooh' took several
guineas out of my pocket."</p>

<p>Fashionable as the Sympathetic Powder was for
several years, it fell into complete disrepute in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
country before the death of Sir Kenelm. Hartman,
the Knight's attached servant, could, of his own experience,
say nothing more for it than, when dissolved
in water, it was a useful astringent lotion in
cases of bleeding from the nose; but he mentions a
certain "Mr. Smith, in the city of Augusta, in Germany,
who told me that he had a great respect for
Sir D. K.'s books, and that he made his sympatheticall
powder every year, and did all his chiefest cures with
it in green wounds, with much greater ease to the
patient than if he had used ointments or plaisters."</p>

<p>In 1643 Sir Kenelm Digby was released from the
confinement to which he had been subjected by the
Parliament. The condition of his liberty was that
he forthwith retired to the Continent—having previously
pledged his word as a Christian and a gentleman,
in no way to act or plot against the Parliament.
In France he became a celebrity of the highest
order. Returning to England with the Restoration,
he resided in "the last fair house westward in
the north portico of Covent Garden," and became
the centre of literary and scientific society. He was
appointed a member of the council of the Royal Society,
on the incorporation of that learned body in
the year 1663. His death occurred in his sixty-second
year, on the 11th of June, 1665; and his funeral took
place in Christ's Church, within Newgate, where,
several years before, he had raised a splendid tomb
to the memory of the lovely and abandoned Venetia.
His epitaph, by the pen of R. Ferrar, is concise,
and not too eulogistic for a monumental inscription:—</p>

<div class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Under this tomb the matchless Digby lies—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Digby the great, the valiant, and the wise;<br></span>
<span class="i0">This age's wonder for his noble parts,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Skill'd in six tongues, and learned in all the arts.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Born on the day he died—the Eleventh of June—<br></span>
<span class="i0">And that day bravely fought at Scanderoon.<br></span>
<span class="i0">It's rare that one and the same day should be<br></span>
<span class="i0">His day of birth, and death, and victory."</span>
</div>

<p>After his death, with the approval of his son, was
published (1669), "The Closet of the Eminently
Learned Sir Kenelme Digbie, Kt., Opened: Whereby
is discovered Several ways for making of Metheglin,
Sider, Cherry-Wine, &amp;c.; together with excellent
Directions for Cookery: as also for Preserving, Conserving,
Candying, &amp;c." The frontispiece of this
work is a portrait of Sir Kenelm, with a shelf over
his head, adorned with his five principal works, entitled,
"Plants," "Sym. Powder," "His Cookery,"
"Rects. in Physick, &amp;c.," "Sr. K. Digby of Bodyes."</p>

<p>In Sir Kenelm's receipts for cookery the gastronome
would find something to amuse him, and more
to arouse his horror. Minced pies are made (as they
still are amongst the homely of some counties) of
<i>meat</i>, raisins, and spices, mixed. Some of the sweet
dishes very closely resemble what are still served on
English tables. The potages are well enough. But
the barley-puddings, pear-puddings, and oat-meal
puddings give ill promise to the ear. It is recommended
to batter up a couple of eggs and a lot of
brown sugar in a cup of tea;—a not less impious
profanation of the sacred leaves than that committed
by the Highlanders, mentioned by Sir Walter Scott,
who, ignorant of the proper mode of treating a pound
of fragrant Bohea, served it up in—melted butter!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>SIR HANS SLOANE.</h3>


<p>The lives of three physicians—Sydenham, Sir Hans
Sloane, and Heberden—completely bridge over the
uncertain period between old empiricism and modern
science. The son of a wealthy Dorsetshire squire,
Sydenham was born in 1624, and received the most
important part of his education in the University of
Oxford, where he was created Bachelor of Medicine
14th April, 1648. Settling in London about 1661,
he was admitted a Licentiate of the Royal College of
Physicians 25th June, 1665. Subsequently he acquired
an M.D. degree at Cambridge, but this step
he did not take till 17th May, 1676. He also studied
physic at Montpellier; but it may be questioned if
his professional success was a consequence of his
labours in any seat of learning, so much as a result
of that knowledge of the world which he gained in
the Civil war as a captain in the Parliamentary army.
It was he who replied to Sir Richard Blackmore's
inquiry after the best course of study for a medical
student to pursue—"Read Don Quixote; it is a very
good book—I read it still." Medical critics have felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
it incumbent on themselves to explain away this memorable
answer—attributing it to the doctor's cynical
temper rather than his scepticism with regard to
medicine. When, however, the state of medical science
in the seventeenth century is considered, one has
not much difficulty in believing that the shrewd physician
meant exactly what he said. There is no question
but that as a practitioner he was a man of many
doubts. The author of the capital sketch of Sydenham
in the "Lives of British Physicians" says—"At
the commencement of his professional life it is
handed down to us by tradition, that it was his ordinary
custom, when consulted by his patients for
the first time, to hear attentively the story of their
complaints, and then say, 'Well, I will consider of
your case, and in a few days will order something
for you.' But he soon discovered that this deliberate
method of proceeding was not satisfactory, and that
many of the persons so received forgot to come again;
and he was consequently obliged to adopt the usual
practice of prescribing immediately for the diseases
of those who sought his advice." A doctor who feels
the need for such deliberation must labour under
considerable perplexity as to the proper treatment
of his patient. But the low opinion he expressed to
Blackmore of books as instructors in medicine, he
gave publicly with greater decorum, but almost as
forcibly, in a dedication addressed to Dr. Mapletoft,
where he says, "The medical art could not be learned
so well and so surely as by use and experience; and
that he who would pay the nicest and most accurate
attention to the symptoms of distempers would succeed
best in finding out the true means of cure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Sydenham died in his house, in Pall Mall, on the
29th of December, 1689. In his last years he was a
martyr to gout, a malady fast becoming one of the
good things of the past. Dr. Forbes Winslow, in his
"Physic and Physicians"—gives a picture, at the
same time painful and laughable, of the doctor's sufferings.
"Sydenham died of the gout; and in the
latter part of his life is described as visited with that
dreadful disorder, and sitting near an open window,
on the ground floor of his house, in St. James's
Square, respiring the cool breeze on a summer's evening,
and reflecting, with a serene countenance and
great complacency, on the alleviation to human misery
that his skill in his art enabled him to give.
Whilst this divine man was enjoying one of these
delicious reveries, a thief took away from the table,
near to which he was sitting, a silver tankard filled
with his favourite beverage, small beer, in which a
sprig of rosemary had been immersed, and ran off
with it. Sydenham was too lame to ring his bell, and
too feeble in his voice to give the alarm."</p>

<p>Heberden, the medical friend of Samuel Johnson,
was born in London in 1710, and died on the 17th of
May, 1801. Between Sydenham and Heberden came
Sir Hans Sloane, a man ever to be mentioned honourably
amongst those physicians who have contributed
to the advancement of science, and the amelioration
of society.</p>

<p>Pope says:—</p>

</p>

<p>Hans Sloane (the seventh and youngest child of
Alexander Sloane, receiver-general of taxes for the
county of Down, before and after the Civil war, and
a commissioner of array, after the restoration of
Charles II.) was born at Killileagh in 1660. An
Irishman by birth, and a Scotchman by descent, he
exhibited in no ordinary degree the energy and politeness
of either of the sister countries. After a
childhood of extreme delicacy he came to England,
and devoted himself to medical study and scientific
investigation. Having passed through a course of
careful labour in London, he visited Paris and Montpellier,
and, returning from the Continent, became
the intimate friend of Sydenham. On the 21st of
January, 1685, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Society; and on the 12th of April, 1687, he became a
Fellow of the College of Physicians. In the September
of the latter year he sailed to the West Indies,
in the character of physician to the Duke of Albemarle,
who had been appointed Governor of Jamaica.
His residence in that quarter of the globe was not of
long duration. On the death of his Grace the doctor
attended the Duchess back to England, arriving once
more in London in the July of 1689. From that time
he remained in the capital—his professional career,
his social position, and his scientific reputation being
alike brilliant. From 1694 to 1730, he was a physician
of Christ's Hospital. On the 30th of November,
1693, he was elected Secretary of the Royal Society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
In 1701 he was made an M.D. of Oxford; and in 1705
he was elected into the fellowship of the College of
Physicians of Edinburgh. In 1708 he was chosen a
Fellow of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris.
Four years later he was elected a member of the
Royal Society of Berlin. In 1719 he became president
of the College of Physicians; and in 1727 he
was created President of the Royal Society (on the
death of Sir Isaac Newton), and was appointed physician
to King George II. In addition to these honours,
he won the distinction of being the first<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/40161/40161-h/40161-h.htm#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> medical
practitioner advanced to the dignity of a baronetcy.</p>

<p>In 1742, Sir Hans Sloane quitted his professional
residence at Bloomsbury; and in the society of his
library, museum, and a select number of scientific
friends, spent the last years of his life at Chelsea,
the manor of which parish he had purchased in 1722.</p>

<p>In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for 1748, there is a
long but interesting account of a visit paid by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Prince and Princess of Wales to the Baronet's museum.
Sir Hans received his royal guests and entertained
them with a banquet of curiosities, the tables
being cleverly shifted, so that a succession of
"courses," under glass cases, gave the charm of variety
to the labours of observation.</p>

<p>In his old age Sir Hans became sadly penurious,
grudging even the ordinary expenses of hospitality.
His intimate friend, George Edwards, F.R.S., gives,
in his "Gleanings of Natural History," some particulars
of the old Baronet, which present a stronger
picture of his parsimony than can be found in the
pages of his avowed detractors.</p>

<p>"Sir Hans, in the decline of his life, left London
and retired to his manor-house, at Chelsea, where
he resided about fourteen years before he died.
After his retirement at Chelsea, he requested it as
a favour to him (though I embraced it as an honour
due to myself), that I would visit him every week,
in order to divert him for an hour or two with the
common news of the town, and with everything particular
that should happen amongst his acquaintance
of the Royal Society, and other ingenious gentlemen,
many of whom I was weekly conversant with; and
I seldom missed drinking coffee with him on a Saturday,
during the whole time of his retirement at
Chelsea. He was so infirm as to be wholly confined
to his house, except sometimes, though rarely, taking
a little air in his garden in a wheeled chair; and this
confinement made him very desirous to see any of his
old acquaintance, to amuse him. He was strictly
careful that I should be at no expense in my journeys
from London to Chelsea to wait on him, knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that I did not superabound in the gifts of fortune.
He would calculate what the expense of coach-hire,
waterage, or any other little charge that might attend
on my journeys backward and forward would amount
to, and would oblige me annually to accept of it,
though I would willingly have declined it."</p>

<p>Such generosity speaks of a parsimonious temper
and habit more forcibly than positive acts of stinginess
would.</p>

<p>On the death of Sir Hans Sloane, on the 11th of
January, 1753, his museum and library passed into
the hands of the nation for a comparatively small
sum of money, and became the nucleus of our British
Museum.</p>

<p>The Royal Society of Sir Hans Sloane's time differed
widely from the Royal Society of the present
day. The reader of Mr. Charles Weld's history of
that distinguished fraternity smiles a painful smile
at the feeble steps of its first members in the direction
of natural science. The efficacy of the divining
rod, and the merits of Sir Kenelm Digby's sympathetic
powder, were the subjects that occupied the
attention of the philosophers of Charles II.'s reign.
Entries such as the following are the records of their
proceedings:—</p>

<p>"<i>June 5.</i>—Col. Tuke related the manner of the
rain like corn at Norwich, and Mr Boyle and Mr Evelyn
were entreated to sow some of those rained seeds
to try their product.</p>

<p>"Magneticall cures were then discoursed of. Sir
Gilbert Talbot promised to bring what he knew of
sympathetical cures. Those that had any powder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of sympathy were desired to bring some of it at the
next meeting.</p>

<p>"Mr Boyle related of a gentleman, who, having
made some experiments of the ayre, essayed the
quicksilver experiment at the top and bottom of a
hill, when there was found three inches difference.</p>

<p>"Dr Charleton promised to bring in that white
powder, which, put into water, heates that.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Buckingham promised to cause
charcoal to be distilled by his chymist.</p>

<p>"His Grace promised to bring into the society a
piece of a unicorne's horn.</p>

<p>"Sir Kenelme Digby related that the calcined powder
of toades reverberated, applyed in bagges upon
the stomach of a pestiferate body, cures it by several
applications."</p>

<p>"<i>June 13.</i>—Colonel Tuke brought in the history
of rained seedes, which were reported to have fallen
downe from heaven in Warwickshire and Shropshire,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>"That the dyving engine be going forward with
all speed, and the treasurer to procure the lead and
moneys.</p>

<p>"Ordered, that Friday next the engine be tried
at Deptford."</p>

<p>"<i>June 26.</i>—Dr Ent, Dr Clarke, Dr Goddard, and
Dr Whistler, were appointed curators of the proposition
made by Sir G. Talbot, to torment a man presently
with the sympatheticall powder.</p>

<p>"Sir G. Talbot brought in his experiments of the
sympathetick cures."</p>

<p>It is true that these passages relate to transactions
of the Royal Society that occurred long before Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Hans was one of the body. But even in his time the
advances made towards greater enlightenment were
few and feeble, when compared with the strides of
science during the last century. So simple and childish
were the operations and speculations of the Society
in the first half of the eighteenth century, that
even Sir John Hill was able to cover them with ridicule.</p>

<p>Sir Hans had two medical successors in the presidentship
of the Royal Society—Sir John Pringle,
Bart., elected Nov. 30, 1772, and William Hyde Wollaston,
M.D., elected June 29, 1820. The last-mentioned
physician had but a brief tenure of the dignity,
for he retired from the exalted post on Nov. 30, 1820,
in favor of Sir Humphrey Davy, Bart.</p>

<p>Humphrey Davy (the son of the Penzance woodcarver,
who was known to his acquaintances as "Little
Carver Davy") was the most acute natural philosopher
of his generation, and at the same time about
the vainest and most eccentric of his countrymen.
With all his mental energy, he was disfigured by a
moral pettiness, which, to a certain extent, justified
Wordsworth's unaccustomed bitterness in "A Poet's
Epitaph":—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Physician art thou? one all eyes;<br></span>
<span class="i1">Philosopher? a fingering slave,<br></span>
<span class="i0">One that would peep and botanize<br></span>
<span class="i1">Upon his mother's grave!<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wrapt closely in thy sensual fleece,<br></span>
<span class="i1">O turn aside—and take, I pray,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That he below may rest in peace,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thy ever-dwindling soul away!"<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>At the summit of his success, Davy was morbidly
sensitive of the humility of his extraction. That his
father had been a respectable mechanic—that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
mother, on her husband's death, had established herself
as milliner in Penzance, in order to apprentice
her son to an apothecary in that town—that by his
own intellects, in the hard battle of life, he had raised
himself from obscure poverty to a brilliant eminence—were
to him facts of shame, instead of pride. In
contradiction to this moral cowardice, there was in
him, on some points, an extravagant eccentricity,
which, in most men, would have pointed to imperviousness
to ridicule. The demands of society, and
the labours of his laboratory, of course left him with
but little leisure. He, however, affected not to have
time enough for the ordinary decencies of the toilet.
Cold ablutions neither his constitution nor his philosophic
temperament required, so he rarely washed
himself. And, on the plea of saving time, he used to
put on his clean linen over his dirty—so that he has
been known to wear at the same time five shirts and
five pairs of stockings. On the rare occasions when
he divested himself of his superfluous integuments,
he caused infinite perplexity to his less intimate
friends, who could not account for his rapid transition
from corpulence to tenuity.</p>

<p>The ludicrousness of his costume did not end there.
Like many other men of powerful and excitable
minds, he was very fond of angling; and on the banks
of the Thames he might be found, at all unsuitable
seasons, in a costume that must have been a source of
no common merriment to the river nymphs. His
coat and breeches were of green cloth. On his head
he wore a hat that Dr. Paris describes as "having
been originally intended for a coal-heaver, but as
having, when in its raw state, been dyed green by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
some sort of pigment." In this attire Davy flattered
himself that he resembled vegetable life as closely as
it was possible for mortal to do.</p>

<p>But if his angling dress was droll, his shooting
costume was more so. His great fear as an angler was
that the fish should escape him; his greatest anxiety
as a bearer of a gun was to escape being shot. In
the one character, concealment was his chief object—in
the other, revelation. So that he might be seen
from a distance, and run fewer chances of being fired
into by accident, he was accustomed on shooting excursions,
to crown himself with a broad-brimmed
hat, covered with scarlet. It never struck him that,
in our Protestant England, he incurred imminent
peril of being mistaken for a cardinal, and knocked
over accordingly.</p>

<p>Naturally, Davy was of a poetical temperament;
and some of his boyish poetry possesses merit that
unquestionably justifies the anticipation formed by
his poet-friends of the flights his more mature muse
would take. But when his intellect became absorbed
in the pursuits by which he rendered inestimable
service to his species, he never renewed the bright
imaginings of his day-spring.</p>

<p>On passing (in 1809) through the galleries of the
Louvre, he could find nothing more worthy of admiration
than the fine frames of the pictures. "What
an extraordinary collection of fine frames!" he observed
to the gentleman who acted as his guide,
amidst the treasures of art gathered from every part
of the Continent. His attention was directed to the
"Transfiguration"; when, on its being suggested to
him that he was looking at a rather well-executed picture,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
he said, coldly, "Indeed! I am glad I have seen
it." In the same way, the statues were to him simply
blocks of material. In the Apollo Belvidere, the
Laocoon, and the Venus dei Medici, he saw no beauty;
but when his eyes rested on the Antinous, treated in
the Egyptian style, and sculptured in alabaster, he
made an exclamation of delight, and cried, "Gracious
powers, what a beautiful stalactite!"</p>

<p>More amusing than even these criticisms, is a story
told of Lady Davy, who accompanied her husband
to Paris. She was walking in the Tuileries garden,
wearing the fashionable London bonnet of the day—shaped
like a cockle-shell. The Parisians, who just
then were patronizing bonnets of enormous dimensions,
were astounded at the apparition of a head-dress
so opposed to their notions of the everlasting
fitness of things; and with the good breeding for
which they are and have long been proverbial, they
surrounded the daring stranger, and stared at her.
This was sufficiently unpleasant to a timid English
lady. But her discomfort had only commenced. Ere
another minute or two had elapsed, one of the inspectors
of the garden approached, and telling her Ladyship
that no cause of <i>rassemblement</i> could be permitted
in that locality, requested her to retire.
Alarmed and indignant, she appealed to some officers
of the Imperial Guard, but they could afford her no
assistance. One of them politely offered her his arm,
and proposed to conduct her to a carriage. But by
the time she had decided to profit by the courtesy,
such a crowd had gathered together, that it was
found necessary to send for a guard of infantry, and
remove <i>la belle Anglaise</i>, surrounded with bayonets.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>THE APOTHECARIES AND SIR SAMUEL GARTH.</h3>


<p>Baldwin Hamey, whose manuscript memoirs of
eminent physicians are among the treasures of the
College, praises Winston because he treated his apothecary
as a master might a slave. "Heriliter imperavit,"
says the Doctor. The learned Thomas Winston,
anatomy lecturer at Gresham College, lived to
the age of eighty years, and died on the 24th of
October, 1655. He knew, therefore, apothecaries in
the day of their humility—before prosperity had
encouraged them to compete with their professional
superiors.</p>

<p>The apothecaries of the Elizabethan era compounded
their medicines much as medicines are compounded
at the present—as far as manipulation and
measuring are concerned. Prescriptions have altered,
but shop-customs have undergone only a very slight
change. The apothecaries' table of weights and
measures, still in use, was the rule in the sixteenth
century, and the symbols (for a pound, an ounce, a
drachm, a scruple, a grain, &amp;c.) remain at this day
just what they were three hundred years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>Our good friend, William Bulleyn, gave the following
excellent rules for an apothecary's life and
conduct:—</p>

<p class="center">"THE APOTICARYE.</p>

<p>"1.—Must fyrst serve God, forsee the end, be
clenly, pity the poore.</p>

<p>"2.—Must not be suborned for money to hurt mankynde.</p>

<p>"3.—His place of dwelling and shop to be clenly
to please the sences withal.</p>

<p>"4.—His garden must be at hand with plenty of
herbes, seedes, and rootes.</p>

<p>"5.—To sow, set, plant, gather, preserve and kepe
them in due tyme.</p>

<p>"6.—To read Dioscorides, to know ye natures of
plants and herbes.</p>

<p>"7.—To invent medicines to chose by coloure, tast,
odour, figure, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"8.—To have his morters, stilles, pottes, filters,

<p>The apothecaries to whom these excellent directions
were given were only tradesmen—grocers who
paid attention to the commands of physicians. They
were not required to have any knowledge of the medical
science, beyond what might be obtained by the
perusal of two or three writers; they were not to presume
to administer drugs on their own judgment and
responsibility—or to perform any surgical operation,
except phlebotomy, and that only for one malady. The
custom was for the doctors to sell their most valuable
remedies as nostrums, keeping their composition a secret
to themselves, and themselves taking the price
paid for them by the sick. The commoner drugs were
vended to patients by the drug-merchants (who invariably
dealt in groceries for culinary use, as well
as in medicinal simples), acting under the directions
of the learned graduates of the Faculty.</p>

<p>In the fourth year of James I., a charter was obtained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that "Willed, ordained, and granted, that all
and singular the Freemen of the Mystery of Grocers
and Apothecaries of the City of London ...
should and might be ... one body corporate
and politique, in deed, fact, and name, by the name
of Warden and Commonalty of the Mystery of Grocers
of the City of London." But in the thirteenth
year of the same king, the apothecaries and grocers
were disunited. At the advice of Theodore de Mayerne
and Henry Atkins, doctors in physick, another
charter was granted, constituting drug-venders a distinct
company. Amongst the apothecaries mentioned
in this charter are the names of the most respectable
families of the country. Gideon de Laune, one of this
first batch of apothecaries, amassed a very large fortune
in his vocation, and founded a family at Sharsted,
in Kent, from which several persons of distinction
draw part of their origin; and not a few of De
Laune's brethren were equally lucky.</p>

<p>At their first foundation as a company the apothecaries
were put completely under control of the College
of Physicians, who were endowed with dangerous
powers of inspecting their wares and punishing their
malpractices. But before a generation had passed
away, the apothecaries had gained such a firm footing
in society that the more prosperous of them could
afford to laugh at the censures of the College; and
before the close of a century they were fawned upon
by young physicians, and were in a position to quarrel
with the old.</p>

<p>The doctors of that day knew so little that the
apothecaries found it easy to know as much. A
knowledge of the herbals, an acquaintance with the ingredients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and doses of a hundred empirical compounds
and systems of maltreating eruptive fevers,
gout, and consumption, constituted all the medical
learning of such men as Mayerne or Gibbons. To
pick up that amount of information was no hard task
for an ambitious apothecary.</p>

<p>Soon the leading apothecaries began to prescribe on
their own responsibility, without the countenance of
a member of the College. If they were threatened
with censure or other punishment by a regular physician,
they retorted by discontinuing to call him in
to consultations. Jealousies soon sprang up. Starving
graduates, with the diplomas of Oxford and Cambridge
and the certificates of the College in their pockets,
were embittered by having to trudge the pavements
of London, and see the mean medicine-mixers
(who had scarce scholarship enough to construe a
Latin bill) dashing by in their carriages. Ere long
the heartburnings broke out in a paper warfare, as
rancorous and disreputable as any squabble embalmed
in literature. The scholars called the rich tradesmen
thieves, swindlers, and unlettered blockheads. The
rich tradesmen taunted the scholars with discontent,
falsehood, and ignorance of everything except Latin
and Greek.</p>

<p>Pope took the side of the physicians. Like Johnson,
Parr, and all men of enlightenment and sound
scholarship, he had a high opinion of the Faculty. It
is indeed told of him, on questionable authority, that
on his death-bed, when he heard the bickerings of Dr.
Burton and Dr. Thompson, each accusing the other of
maltreating his patient, he levelled with his last
breath an epigram at the two rivals—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Dunces, rejoice, forgive all censures past—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">The greatest dunce has killed your foe at last."</span>
</div>

<p>To Dr. Arbuthnot he wrote—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Friend to my life, which did not you prolong,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The world had wanted many an idle song."</span>
</div>

<p>His feeble health, making his life a long disease,
never allowed him vigour and confidence enough to
display ingratitude to the Faculty, and illustrate the
truth of the lines—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"God and the doctor we alike adore,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But only when in danger, not before;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The danger o'er, both are alike requited,<br></span>
<span class="i0">God is forgotten, and the doctor slighted."</span>
</div>

<p>His habitual tone, when speaking of the medical
profession, was that of warm admiration and affection.
In the "Imitations of Horace" he says—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Weak though I am of limb, and short of sight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Far from a lynx, and not a giant quite,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I'll do what Mead and Cheselden advise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To keep these limbs, and to preserve these eyes."</span>
</div>

<p>It is true that he elsewhere ridicules Mead's fondness
for rare books and Sloane's passion for butterflies;
but at the close of his days he wrote in a confidential
letter to a friend of the Faculty, "They are
in general the most amiable companions and the best
friends, as well as the most learned men I know."</p>

<p>In the protracted dissensions between the physicians
and the apothecaries Pope was a cordial supporter
of the former. When he accused, in the "Essay
on Criticism," the penny-a-lining critics of acquiring
their slender knowledge of the poetic art from
the poets they assailed, he compared them to apothecaries
whose scientific information was pilfered from
the prescriptions they were required to dispense.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Then Criticism the Muse's handmaid proved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">To dress her charms and make her more beloved:<br></span>
<span class="i0">But following wits from that intention stray'd.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who could not win the mistress, woo'd the maid;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Against the poets their own arms they turn'd,<br></span>

</div>

<p>The origin of the memorable Dispensarian Campaign
between the College of Physicians and the
Company of Apothecaries is a story that can be
briefly told. The younger physicians, impatient at
beholding the prosperity and influence of the apothecaries,
and the older ones indignant at seeing a class
of men they despised creeping into their quarters and
craftily laying hold of a portion of their monopoly,
concocted a scheme to reinstate themselves in public
favour. Without a doubt many of the physicians who
countenanced this scheme gave it their support from
purely charitable motives; but it cannot be questioned
that as a body the dispensarians were actuated in
their humanitarian exertions by a desire to lower
the apothecaries, and raise themselves in the eyes of the
world. With all its genuine and sterling benevolence,
the medical profession, by the unworthy and silly
conduct of its obscure members, has repeatedly laid
itself open to the charge of trading on its reputation
for humanity. In Smollett's time, as his novels show,
the recognized mode employed by unknown doctors
to puff themselves into notoriety and practice, was to
get up little hospitals and infirmaries, and advertise
to the charitable for aid in the good task of ameliorating
the condition of the poor. And half the peddling
little charitable institutions, infirmaries, dispensaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
or hospitals, that at the present time rob the rich and
do harm to the poor in every quarter of London,
originated in "the friends" of young physicians and
surgeons conspiring together to get them "the position
of being attached to an hospital staff." In 1687,
the physicians at a college-meeting, voted "that all
members of the College, whether Fellows, Candidates,
or Licentiates, should give their advice gratis to all
their sick neighbouring poor, when desired, within
the city of London, or seven miles round."</p>

<p>To give prescriptions to the very poor, unaccompanied
with the means of getting them dispensed, is
of little use. Sir Astley Cooper used to see in the
vicinity of his residence the slips of paper, marked
with his pen, which it was his wont to distribute
gratuitously to indigent applicants. The fact was,
the poor people, finding it beyond their means to pay
the druggist for dispensing them, threw them away in
disgust. It was just the same in 1687. The poor folk
carried their prescriptions to the apothecaries, to
learn that the trade charge for dispensing them was
beyond their means. The physicians asserted that the
demands of the drug-venders were extortionate, and
were not reduced to meet the finances of the applicants,
to the end that the undertakings of benevolence
might prove abortive. This was of course absurd.
The apothecaries knew their own interests better
than so to oppose a system which at least rendered
drug-consuming fashionable with the lower orders.
Perhaps they regarded the poor as their peculiar field
of practice, and felt insulted at having the same
humble people—for whom they had pompously prescribed
and put up boluses at two-pence apiece—now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
entering their shops with papers dictating what the
two-penny bolus was to be composed of. But the
charge preferred against them was groundless. Indeed,
a numerous body of the apothecaries expressly
offered to sell medicines "to the poor within their respective
parishes, at such rates as the committee of
physicians should think reasonable."</p>

<p>But this would not suit the game of the physicians.
"A proposal was started by a committee of the College,
that the College should furnish the medicines
of the poor, and perfect alone that charity which the
apothecaries refused to concur in; and after divers
methods ineffectually tried, and much time wasted
in endeavouring to bring the Apothecaries to terms of
reason in relation to the poor, an instrument was
subscribed by divers charitably disposed members of
the College, now in number about fifty, wherein they
obliged themselves to pay ten pounds apiece towards
the preparing and delivering medicines at their intrinsic
value." Such was the version of the affair
given by the College apologists. The plan was acted
upon; and a dispensary was eventually established
(some nine years after the vote of 1687) in the College
of Physicians, Warwick Lane, where medicines
were vended to the poor at cost price.</p>

<p>This measure of the College was impolitic and unjustifiable.
It was unjust to that important division
of the trade who were ready to vend the medicines
at rates to be fixed by the College authorities—for
it took altogether out of their hands the small amount
of profit which they, as <i>dealers</i>, could have realized on
those terms. It was also an eminently unwise course.
The College sank to the level of the Apothecaries'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Hall, becoming an emporium for the sale of medicines.
It was all very well to say that no profit was
made on such sale—the censorious world would not
believe it. The apothecaries and their friends denied
that such was the fact, and avowed that the benevolent
dispensarians were bent only on underselling
and ruining them.</p>

<p>Again, the movement introduced dissension within
the walls of the College. Many of the first physicians,
with the conservatism of success, did not care to offend
the apothecaries, who were continually calling
them in, and paying them fees. They therefore joined
in the cry against the dispensary. The profession
was split up into dispensarians and anti-dispensarians.
The apothecaries combined and agreed not to
recommend the dispensarians. The anti-dispensarians
repaid this ill service by refusing to meet dispensarians
in consultation. Sir Thomas Millington, the
president of the College, Edward Hulse, Hans Sloane,
John Woodward, Sir Edmund King, and Samuel
Garth were amongst the latter. Of them the last-named
was the man who rendered the most efficient
service to his party.</p>

<p>Garth is perhaps the most cherished by the present
generation of all the physicians of Pope's time. He
was a Whig without rancour, and a bon-vivant without
selfishness. Full of jest and amiability, he did
more to create merriment at the Kit-Kat club than
either Swift or Arbuthnot. He loved wine to excess;
but then wine loved him too, ripening and warming
his wit, and leaving no sluggish humour behind. His
practice was a good one, but his numerous patients
prized his <i>bon-mots</i> more than his prescriptions. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
enemies averred that he was not only an epicure, but
a profligate voluptuary and an infidel. Pope, however,
wrote of him after his death, "If ever there was
a good Christian, without knowing himself to be so,
it was Dr. Garth." Pope had honoured him when
alive by dedicating his second pastoral to him.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Accept, O Garth, the muse's early lays,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That adds this wreath of ivy to thy bays;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Hear what from love unpractised hearts endure,<br></span>
<span class="i0">From love, the sole disease thou canst not cure."</span>
</div>

<p>A good picture of Garth the politician is found in
the "Journal to Stella." "London, Nov. 17, 1711,"
writes Swift—"This is Queen Elizabeth's birthday,
usually kept in this town by apprentices, &amp;c.; but the
Whigs designed a mighty procession by midnight, and
had laid out a thousand pounds to dress up the pope,
devil, cardinals, Sacheverel, &amp;c., and carry them with
torches about and burn them. They did it by contribution.
Garth gave five guineas; Dr. Garth I mean,
if ever you heard of him. But they were seized last
night by order from the Secretary.... The
figures are now at the Secretary's Office at Whitehall.
I design to see them if I can."</p>

<p>A Whig, but the friend of Tories, Garth cordially
disliked Sir Richard Blackmore, a member of his own
profession and political party. Blackmore was an
anti-dispensarian, a bad poet, and a pure and rigid
moralist. Naturally Garth abominated him, and
sneered at him for his pomposity and bad scholarship.
It is to be regretted that Garth, with the vulgarity of
the age, twitted him with his early poverty, and with
having been—a schoolmaster. To ridicule his enemy
Garth composed the following verses:—</p>

<p class="center"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>"TO THE MERRY POETASTER, AT SADLER'S
HALL, IN CHEAPSIDE.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Unwieldy pedant, let thy awkward muse<br></span>
<span class="i0">With censures praise, with flatteries abuse;<br></span>
<span class="i0">To lash, and not be felt, in thee's an art,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That ne'er mad'st any but thy school-boys smart.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Then be advised and scribble not again—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thou'rt fashion'd for a flail and not a pen.<br></span>
<span class="i0">If B——l's immortal wit thou would'st decry,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pretend 'tis he that wrote thy poetry.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy feeble satire ne'er can do him wrong—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thy poems and thy patients live not long."</span>
</div>

<p>Garth's death, as described by William Ayre, was
characteristic. He was soon tired of an invalid's suffering
and helplessness, the <i>ennui</i> and boredom of the
sick-room afflicting him more than the bodily pain.
"Gentlemen," said he to the crowd of weeping friends
who stood round his bed, "I wish the ceremony of
death was over." And so, sinking lower in the bed,
he died without a struggle. He had previously, on
being informed that his end was approaching, expressed
pleasure at the intelligence, because he was
tired of having his shoes pulled off and on. The manner
of Garth's exit reminds one of the death of Rabelais,
also a physician. The presence of officious
friends troubled him; and when he saw his doctors
consulting together, he raised his head from his pillow
and said with a smile, "Dear gentlemen, let me
die a natural death." After he had received extreme
unction, a friend approached him, and asked him how
he did. "I am going on my journey," was the answer—"they
have greased my boots already."</p>

<p>Garth has, apart from his literary productions, one
great claim on posterity. To him Dryden owed honourable
interment. When the great poet died, Garth
caused his body to be conveyed to the College of Physicians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and started a public subscription to defray
the expenses of the funeral. He pronounced an oration
over the deceased at the College in Warwick
Lane, and then accompanied it to Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Of the stories preserved of Garth's social humour
some are exquisitely droll. Writing a letter at a coffee-house,
he found himself overlooked by a curious
Irishman, who was impudently reading every word
of the epistle. Garth took no notice of the impertinence,
until he had finished and signed the body of
the letter, when he added a postscript, of unquestionable
legibility: "I would write you more by this
post, but there's a d—— tall impudent Irishman looking
over my shoulder all the time."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?" roared the Irishman in
a fury. "Do you think I looked over your letter?"</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the physician, "I never once opened
my lips to you."</p>

<p>"Ay, but you have put it down, for all that."</p>

<p>"'Tis impossible, sir, that you should know that,
for you have never once looked over my letter."</p>

<p>Stumbling into a Presbyterian church one Sunday,
for pastime, he found a pathetic preacher shedding
tears over the iniquity of the earth.</p>

<p>"What makes the man greet?" asked Garth of a
bystander.</p>

<p>"By my faith," was the answer, "and you too
would greet if you were in his place and had as little
to say."</p>

<p>"Come along, my dear fellow," responded Garth
to his new acquaintance, "and dine with me. You are
too good a fellow to be here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>At the Kit-Kat he once stayed to drink long after
he had said that he must be off to see his patients. Sir
Richard, more humane than the physician, or possibly,
like the rest of the world, not disinclined to be
virtuous at another's expense, observed, "Really,
Garth, you ought to have no more wine, but be off to
see those poor devils."</p>

<p>"It's no great matter," Garth replied, "whether I
see them to-night or not, for nine of them have such
bad constitutions, that all the physicians in the world
can't save them; and the other six have such good
constitutions, that all the physicians in the world can't
kill them."</p>

<p>Born of a respectable north-country family, Garth
was educated first at a provincial school, and then at
Cambridge. He was admitted a Fellow of the College
of Physicians on June 26, 1692, just when the
quarrel of the Physicians and Apothecaries was waxing
to its hottest, <i>i. e.</i> between the College edict of
1687, ordaining gratuitous advice, and the creation
of the dispensary in 1696. As a young man he saw
that his right place was with the dispensarians—and
he took it. For a time his great poem, "The Dispensary,"
covered the apothecaries and anti-dispensarians
with ridicule. It rapidly passed through numerous
editions—in each of which, as was elegantly observed,
the world lost and gained much. To say that
of all the books, pamphlets, and broad-sheets thrown
out by the combatants on both sides, it is by far the
one of the greatest merit, would be scant justice, when
it might almost be said that it is the only one of them
that can now be read by a gentleman without a sense
of annoyance and disgust. There is no point of view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
from which the medical profession appears in a more
humiliating and contemptible light than that which
the literature of this memorable squabble presents to
the student. Charges of ignorance, dishonesty, and
extortion were preferred on both sides; and the dispensarian
physicians did not hesitate to taunt their
brethren of the opposite camp with playing corruptly
into the hands of the apothecaries—prescribing enormous
and unnecessary quantities of medicine, so that
the drug-venders might make heavy bills, and, as a
consequence, recommend in all directions such complacent
<i>superiors</i> to be called in. Garth's poem, unfair
and violent though it is, seldom offends against
decency. As a work of art it cannot be ranked high,
and is now deservedly forgotten, although it has many
good lines, and some felicitous satire. Johnson rightly
pointed to the secret of its success, though he took
a one-sided and unjust view of the dissensions which
called it forth. "The poem," observes the biographer,
"as its subject was present and popular, co-operated
with passions and prejudices then prevalent; and,
with such auxiliaries to its intrinsic merit, was universally
and liberally applauded. It was on the side
of charity against the intrigues of interest, and of regular
learning against licentious usurpation of medical
authority."</p>

<p>Sir Samuel Garth (knighted by the sword of Marlborough)
died January 18, 1718-19, and was buried at
Harrow-on-the-Hill.</p>

<p>But he lived to see the apothecaries gradually
emancipate themselves from the ignominious regulations
to which they consented, when their vocation
was first separated from the grocery trade. Four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
years after his death they obtained legal acknowledgment
of their right to dispense and sell medicines
without the prescription of a physician; and six years
later the law again decided in their favour, with regard
to the physicians' right of examining and condemning
their drugs. In 1721, Mr. Rose, an apothecary,
on being prosecuted by the College for prescribing
as well as compounding medicines, carried the
matter into the House of Lords, and obtained a favourable
decision. And from 1727, in which year Mr.
Goodwin, an apothecary, obtained in a court of law a
considerable sum for an illegal seizure of his wares
(by Drs. Arbuthnot, Bale, and Levit), the physicians
may be said to have discontinued to exercise their
privileges of inspection.</p>

<p>Arbuthnot did not exceed Garth in love to the
apothecaries. His contempt for, and dislike of, the
fraternity, inspired him to write his "Essay on an
Apothecary." He thinks it a pity that, to prevent
the country from being overrun with apothecaries,
it should not be allowed to anatomize them, for the
improvement of natural knowledge. He ridicules
them for pedantically "dressing all their discourse
in the language of the Faculty."</p>

<p>"At meals," he says, "they distributed their wine
with a little lymph, dissected a widgeon, cohobated
their pease-porridge, and amalgamated a custard. A
morsel of beef was a bolus; a grillard was sacrificed;
eating was mastication and deglutition; a dish of
steaks was a compound of many powerful ingredients;
and a plate of soup was a very exalted preparation.
In dress, a suit of cloaths was a system, a loophole
a valve, and a surtout an integument. Cloth was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
texture of fibres spread into a drab or kersey; a small
rent in it was cutaneous; a thread was a filament;
and the waistband of the breeches the peritoneum."</p>

<p>The superior branch of the Faculty invited in many
ways the same satire. Indeed, pedantry was the prevalent
fault of the manners of the eighteenth century.
The physician, the divine, the lawyer, the parliament-man,
the country gentleman, the author by profession—all
had peculiarities of style, costume, speech, or intonation,
by which they were well pleased they should
be recognised. In one respect, this was well; men were
proud of being what they were, and desired to be
known as belonging to their respective vocations. They
had no anxiety to be free from trade-marks. The
barrister's smirk, the physician's unctuous smiles, the
pedagogue's frown, did not originate in a mean desire
to be taken for something of higher mark and esteem
than they really were.</p>

<p>From the time when Bulleyn called him the physician's
cook, down to the present, generation, the
pure apothecary is found holding a very subordinate
position. His business is to do unpleasant drudgery
that a gentleman finds it unpleasant to perform, but
which cannot be left to the hands of a nurse. The
questions to be considered previous to becoming an
apprentice to an apothecary, put in Chemberlaine's
"Tyrocinium Medicum," well describe the state of
the apothecary's pupil. "Can you bear the thoughts
of being obliged to get up out of your warm bed, on
a cold winter's night, or rather morning, to make up
medicines which your employer, just arrived through
frost and snow, prescribes for a patient taken suddenly
or dangerously ill?—or, supposing that your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
master is not in sufficient business to keep a boy to take
out medicines, can you make up your mind to think
it no hardship to take them to the patient after you
have made them up?" &amp;c., &amp;c. When such services
were expected from pupils studying for admittance
to the craft, of course boys with ample means, or
prospects elsewhere, did not as a rule desire to become
apothecaries.</p>

<p>Within the last fifty years changes have been affected
in various departments of the medical profession,
that have rendered the apothecary a feature of the
past, and transferred his old functions to a new labourer.
Prior to 1788, it is stated on authority there
were not in all London more than half-a-dozen druggists
who dispensed medicines from physicians' prescriptions.
Before that time, the apothecaries—the
members of the Apothecaries' Company—were almost
the sole compounders and preparers of drugs.
At the present time it is exceptional for an apothecary
to put up prescriptions, unless he is acting as the
family or ordinary medical attendant to the patient
prescribed for. As a young man, indeed, he sometimes
condescends to keep an open shop; but as soon
as he can get on without "counter" business, he
leaves the commercial part of his occupation to the
druggist, as beneath his dignity. The dispensing chemists
and druggists, whose shops, flashing with blue
bottles (last remnant of empiric charlatanry), brighten
our street corners and scare our horses at night,
are the apothecaries of the last century. The apothecary
himself—that is, the member of the Company—is
hardly ever found as an apothecary <i>pur et simple</i>.
He enrolls himself at "the hall" for the sake of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
able to sue ungrateful patients for money due to him.
But in the great majority of cases he is also a Fellow
or Member of the College of Surgeons, and acts as a
general practitioner; that is, he does anything and
everything—prescribes and dispenses his prescriptions;
is at the same time physician, surgeon, accoucheur,
and dentist. Physic and surgery were divided
at a very early date in theory, but in practice
they were combined by eminent physicians till a
comparatively recent period. And yet later the physician
performed the functions of the apothecary, just
as the apothecary presumed to discharge the offices
of physician. It was not derogatory to the dignity
of a leading physician, in the reign of Charles the
Second, to keep a shop, and advertise the wares vended
in it, announcing in the same manner their prices.
Dr. Mead realized large sums by the sale of worthless
nostrums. And only a few years since, a distinguished
Cambridge physician, retaining as an octogenarian
the popularity he had achieved as a young
man, in one of our eastern counties, used to sell his
"gout tincture"—a secret specific against gout—at
so many shillings per bottle. In many respects the
general practitioner of this century would consider
his professional character compromised if he adopted
the customs generally in vogue amongst the physicians
of the last.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>QUACKS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>"So then the subject being so variable, hath made the art by
consequence more conjectural; an art being conjectural hath
made so much the more place to be left for imposture. For
almost all other arts and sciences are judged by acts or masterpieces,
as I may term them, and not by the successes and
events. The lawyer is judged by the virtue of his pleading,
and not by the issue of the cause. The master of the ship
is judged by the directing his course aright, and not by the
fortune of the voyage. But the physician, and perhaps the
politician, hath no particular acts demonstrative of his
ability, but is judged most by the event; which is ever but
as it is taken: for who can tell, if a patient die or recover,
or if a state be preserved or ruined, whether it be art or
accident? and therefore many times the impostor is prized,
and the man of virtue taxed. <i>Nay, we see the weakness and
credulity of men is such, as they will often prefer a mountebank
or witch before a learned physician.</i>"—Lord Bacon's
"<i>Advancement of Learning</i>."</p></blockquote>


<p>The history of quackery, if it were written on a
scale that should include the entire number of those
frauds which may be generally classed under the head
of humbug, would be the history of the human race
in all ages and climes. Neither the benefactors nor
the enemies of mankind would escape mention; and
a searching scrutiny would show that dishonesty has
played as important, though not as manifest, a part
in the operations of benevolence, as in the achievements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
of the devil. But a more confined use of the
word must satisfy us on the present occasion. We
are not about to enter on a philosophic inquiry into
the causes that contributed to the success of Mahomet
and Cromwell, but only to chronicle a few of the
most humorous facts connected with the predecessors
of Dr. Townsend and Mr. Morrison.</p>

<p>In the success that has in every century attended
the rascally enterprises of pretenders to the art of
medicine, is found a touching evidence of the sorrow,
credulity, and ignorance of the generations that have
passed, or are passing, to the silent home where the
pain and joy, the simplicity and cunning, of this
world are alike of insignificance. The hope that to
the last lurks in the breast of the veriest wretch under
heaven's canopy, whether his trials come from
broken health, or an empty pocket, or wronged affection,
speaks aloud in saddest tones, as one thinks of
the multitudes who, worn with bodily malady and
spiritual dejection, ignorant of the source of their
sufferings, but thirsting for relief from them, have
gone from charlatan to charlatan, giving hoarded
money in exchange for charms, cramp-rings, warming-stones,
elixirs, and trochees, warranted to cure
every ill that flesh is heir to. The scene, from another
point of view, is more droll, but scarcely less mournful.
Look away for a few seconds from the throng
of miserable objects who press round the empiric's
stage; wipe out for a brief while the memory of their
woes, and regard the style and arts of the practitioner
who, with a trunk full of nostrums, bids disease
to vanish, and death to retire from the scenes of
his triumph. There he stands—a lean, fantastic man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
voluble of tongue, empty-headed, full of loud words
and menaces, prating about kings and princes who
have taken him by the hand and kissed him in gratitude
for his benefits showered upon them—dauntless,
greedy, and so steeped in falsehood that his crazy-tainted
brain half believes the lies that flow from his
glib tongue. Are there no such men amongst us now—not
standing on carts at the street-corners, and selling
their wares to a dingy rabble, but having their
seats of exchange in honoured places, and vending
their prescriptions to crowds of wealthy clients?</p>

<p>In the feudal ages medicine and quackery were
the same, as far as any principles of science are concerned.
The only difference between the physician
and the charlatan was, that the former was a fool
and the latter a rogue. Men did not meddle much
with the healing art. A few clerks devoted themselves
to it, and in the exercise of their spiritual and
medical functions discovered how to get two fleeces
from a sheep at one shearing; but the care of the sick
was for the most part left to the women, who then, as
in every other period of the world's history, prided
themselves on their medical cunning, and, with the
exception of intrigue, preferred attending on the sick
to any other occupation. From the time of the Reformation,
however, the number of lady doctors rapidly
diminished. The fair sex gradually relinquished
the ground they had so long occupied, to men, who,
had the monastic institutions continued to exist, would
have assumed the priestly garb and passed their days
in sloth. Quackery was at length fairly taken out
of the hands of women and the shelter of domestic
life, and was practised, not for love, and in a superstitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
belief in its efficacy, but for money, and frequently
with a perfect knowledge of its worthlessness
as a remedial system.</p>

<p>As soon as the printing-press had become an institution
of the country, and there existed a considerable
proportion of the community capable of reading, the
empirics seized hold of Caxton's invention, and made
it subservient to their honourable ends. The advertising
system was had recourse to in London, during
the Stuart era, scarcely less than it is now. Handbills
were distributed in all directions by half-starved
wretches, whose withered forms and pallid cheeks
were of themselves a sufficient disproof of the assertions
of their employers.</p>

<p>The costume, language, style, and artifices of the
pretenders to physic in the seventeenth century were
doubtless copied from models of long standing, and
differed little in essentials from those of their predecessors.
Professions retain their characteristics with
singular obstinacy. The doctor of Charles the Second's
London transmitted all his most salient features
to the quack of the Regency.</p>

<p>Cotgrave, in his "Treasury of "Wit and Language,"
published 1655, thus paints the poor physician of his
time:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"My name is Pulsefeel, a poor Doctor of Physick,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That does wear three pile velvet in his hat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Has paid a quarter's rent of his house before-hand,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And (simple as he stands here) was made doctor beyond sea.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I vow, as I am right worshipful, the taking<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of my degree cost me twelve French crowns, and<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thirty-five pounds of butter in Upper Germany.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I can make your beauty, and preserve it,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Rectifie your body and maintaine it,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Clarifie your blood, surfle your cheeks, perfume<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your skin, tinct your hair, enliven your eye,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Heighten your appetite; and as for Jellies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Dentifrizes, Dyets, Minerals, Fricasses,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pomatums, Fumes, Italia masks to sleep in,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Either to moisten or dry the superficies, Faugh! Galen<br></span>
<span class="i0">Was a goose, and Paracelsus a Patch,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To Doctor Pulsefeel."</span>
</div>

<p>This picture would serve for the portrait of Dr.
Pulsefeel in the eighteenth and nineteenth, as well as
the seventeenth century. How it calls to mind the
image of Oliver Goldsmith, when, with a smattering
of medical knowledge, a cane, and a dubious diploma,
he tried to pick out of the miseries and ignorance of
his fellow-creatures the means of keeping body and
soul together! He too, poet and scholar though he
was, would have sold a pot of rouge to a faded beauty,
or a bottle of hair-dye, or a nostrum warranted to
cure the bite of a mad dog.</p>

<p>A more accurate picture, however, of the charlatan,
is to be found in "The Quack's Academy; or, The
Dunce's Directory," published in 1678, of which the
following is a portion:—</p>

<p>"However, in the second place, to support this
title, there are several things very convenient: of
which some are external accoutrements, others internal
qualifications.</p>

<p>"Your outward requisites are a decent black suit,
and (if your credit will stretch so far in Long Lane)
a plush jacket; not a pin the worse though threadbare
as a tailor's cloak—it shows the more reverend
antiquity.</p>

<p>"Secondly, like Mercury, you must always carry a
caduceus or conjuring japan in your hand, capt with
a civet-box; with which you must walk with Spanish
gravity, as in deep contemplation upon an arbitrament
between life and death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>"Thirdly, a convenient lodging, not forgetting a
hatch at the door; a chamber hung with Dutch pictures,
or looking-glasses, belittered with empty bottles,
gallipots, and vials filled with tapdroppings, or
fair water, coloured with saunders. Any sexton will
furnish your window with a skull, in hope of your
custom; over which hang up the skeleton of a monkey,
to proclaim your skill in anatomy.</p>

<p>"Fourthly, let your table be never without some
old musty Greek or Arabick author, and the 4th book
of Cornelius Agrippa's 'Occult Philosophy,' wide
open to amuse spectators; with half-a-dozen of gilt
shillings, as so many guineas received that morning
for fees.</p>

<p>"Fifthly, fail not to oblige neighbouring ale-houses,
to recommend you to inquirers; and hold correspondence
with all the nurses and midwives near you, to
applaud your skill at gossippings."</p>

<p>The directions go on to advise loquacity and impudence,
qualities which quacks of all times and kinds
have found most useful. But in cases where the practitioner
has an impediment in his speech, or cannot
by training render himself glib of utterance, he is
advised to persevere in a habit of mysterious silence,
rendered impressive by grave nods of the head.</p>

<p>When Dr. Pulsefeel was tired of London, or felt a
want of country air, he concentrated his powers on
the pleasant occupation of fleecing rustic simplicity.
For his journeys into the provinces he provided
himself with a stout and fast-trotting hack—stout,
that it might bear without fatigue weighty parcels of
medicinal composition; and fleet of foot, so that if an
ungrateful rabble should commit the indecorum of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
stoning their benefactor as an impostor (a mishap
that would occasionally occur), escape might be effected
from the infatuated and excited populace. In
his circuit the doctor took in all the fairs, markets,
wakes, and public festivals; not, however, disdaining
to stop an entire week, or even month, at an assize
town, where he found the sick anxious to benefit by
his wisdom.</p>

<p>His plan of making acquaintance with a new place
was to ride boldly into the thickest crowd of a fair or
market, with as much speed as he could make without
imperilling the lives of by-standers; and then, when
he had checked his steed, inform all who listened that
he had come straight from the Duke of Bohemia, or
the most Serene Emperor of Wallachia, out of a desire
to do good to his fellow-creatures. He was born
in that very town,—yes, that very town in which he
then was speaking, and had left it when an orphan
child of eight years of age, to seek his fortune in the
world. He had found his way to London, and been
crimped on board a vessel bound for Morocco, and so
had been carried off to foreign parts. His adventures
had been wonderful. He had visited the Sultan
and the Great Mogul. There was not a part of the
Indies with which he was not familiar. If any one
doubted him, let his face be regarded, and his bronze
complexion bear witness of the scorching suns he had
endured. He had cured hundreds—ay, thousands—of
emperors, kings, queens, princes, margravines,
grand duchesses, and generalissimos, of their diseases.
He had a powder which would stay the palsy, jaundice,
hot fever, and cramps. It was expensive; but
that he couldn't help, for it was made of pearls, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the dried leaves of violets brought from the very middle
of Tartary; still he could sell a packet of the medicine
for a crown—a sum which would just pay him
back his outlaid money, and leave him no profit. But
he didn't want to make money of them. He was their
fellow-townsman; and in order to find them out and
cure them he had refused offers of wealth from the
king of Mesopotamia, who wanted him to accept a fortune
of a thousand gold pieces a month, tarry with
the Mesopotamians, and keep them out of Death's
clutches. Sometimes this harangue was made from
the back of a horse; sometimes from a rude hustings,
from which he was called <i>mountebank</i>. He sold all
kinds of medicaments: dyes for the hair, washes for
the complexion, lotions to keep young men youthful;
rings which, when worn on the fore-finger of the
right hand, should make a chosen favourite desperately
in love with the wearer, and when worn on the
same finger of the left hand, should drive the said
favourite to commit suicide. Nothing could surpass
the impudence of the fellow's lies, save the admiration
with which his credulous auditors swallowed his assertions.
There they stood,—stout yeomen, drunken
squires, merry peasant girls, gawky hinds, gabbling
dames, deeming themselves in luck's way to have lived
to see such a miracle of learning. Possibly a young
student home from Oxford, with the rashness of inexperience,
would smile scornfully, and in a loud
voice designate the pretender a quack—a quacksalvar
(kwabzalver), from the liniment he vended for the
cure of wens. But such an interruption, in ninety
and nine cases out of every hundred, was condemned
by the orthodox friends of the young student, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
was warned that he would come to no good if he went
on as he had begun—a contemptuous unbeliever, and
a mocker of wise men.</p>

<p>The author of the "Discourse de l'Origine des
Mœurs, Fraudes, et Impostures des Ciarlatans, avec
leur Découverte, Paris, 1662," says, "Premièrement,
par ce mot de Ciarlatans, j'entens ceux que les Italiens
appellent Saltambaci, basteleurs, bouffons, vendeurs
de bagatelles, et generalement toute autre personne,
laquelle en place publique montée en banc, à
terre, ou à cheval, vend medecines, baumes, huilles ou
poudres, composées pour guerir quelque infirmité,
louant et exaltant sa drogue, avec artifice, et mille
faux sermens, en racontant mille et mille merveilles.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;">

<p>"Mais c'est chose plaisante de voir l'artifice dont se
servent ces medecins de banc pour vendre leur drogue,
quand avec mille faux sermens ils affirment d'avoir
appris leur secret du roi de Dannemarc, au d'un
prince de Transilvanie."</p>

<p>The great quack of Charles the Second's London
was Dr. Thomas Saffold. This man (who was originally
a weaver) professed to cure every disease of the
human body, and also to foretell the destinies of his
patients. Along Cheapside, Fleet-street, and the
Strand, even down to the sacred precincts of Whitehall
and St. James's, he stationed bill-distributors,
who showered prose and poetry on the passers-by—just
as the agents (possibly the poets) of the Messrs.
Moses cast their literature on the town of Queen
Victoria. When this great benefactor of his species
departed this life, on May the 12th, 1691, a satirical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
broadsheet called on the world to mourn for the loss
of one—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"So skilled in drugs and verse, 'twas hard to show it,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whether was best, the doctor or the poet."</span>
</div>

<p>The ode continues:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Lament, ye damsels of our London city,<br></span>
<span class="i0">(Poor unprovided girls) tho' fair and witty,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, maskt, would to his house in couples come,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To understand your matrimonial doom;<br></span>
<span class="i0">To know what kind of men you were to marry,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And how long time, poor things, you were to tarry;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Your oracle is silent, none can tell<br></span>
<span class="i0">On whom his astrologick mantle fell:<br></span>
<span class="i0">For he when sick refused all doctors' aid,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And only to his pills devotion paid!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet it was surely a most sad disaster,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The saucy pills at last should kill their master."</span>
</div>

<p class="center">EPITAPH.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Here lies the corpse of Thomas Saffold,<br></span>
<span class="i0">By death, in spite of physick, baffled;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who, leaving off his working loom,<br></span>

<p>The vocation of fortune-teller was exercised not
only by the quacks, but also by the apothecaries, of
that period. Garth had ample foundation, in fact,
for his satirical sketch of Horoscope's shop in the second
canto of "The Dispensary."</p>

<p>Queen Anne's weak eyes caused her to pass from
one empiric to another, for the relief they all promised
to give, and in some cases even persuaded that
they gave her. She had a passion for quack oculists;
and happy was the advertising scoundrel who gained
her Majesty's favour with a new collyrium. For, of
course, if the greatest personage in the land said that
Professor Bungalo was a wonderful man, a master
of his art, and inspired by God to heal the sick, there
was no appeal from so eminent an authority. How
should an elderly lady with a crown on her head be
mistaken? Do we not hear the same arguments every
day in our own enlightened generation, when
the new Chiropodist, or Rubber, or inventor of a specific
for consumption, points to the social distinctions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of his dupes as conclusive evidence that he is neither
supported by vulgar ignorance, nor afraid to meet
the most searching scrutiny of the educated? Good
Queen Anne was so charmed with two of the many
knaves who by turns enjoyed her countenance, that
she had them sworn in as her own oculists in ordinary;
and one of them she was even so silly as to
knight. This lucky gentleman was William Reade,
originally a botching tailor, and to the last a very ignorant
man, as his "Short and Exact Account of all
Diseases Incident to the Eyes" attests; yet he rose to
the honour of knighthood, and the most lucrative and
fashionable physician's practice of his period. Surely
every dog has his day. Lazarus never should despair;
a turn of fortune may one fine day pick him from the
rags which cover his nakedness in the kennel, and
put him to feast amongst princes, arrayed in purple
and fine linen, and regarded as an oracle of wisdom.
It was true that Sir William Reade was unable to
read the book which he had written (by the hand of
an amanuensis), but I have no doubt that many
worthy people who listened to his sonorous voice, beheld
his lace ruffles and gold-headed cane, and saw
his coach drawn along to St. James's by superb horses,
thought him in every respect equal, or even superior,
to Pope and Swift.</p>

<p>When Sir William was knighted he hired a poet,
who lived in Grub Street, to announce the fact to posterity
and "the town," in decasyllabic verse. The production
of this bard, "The Oculist, a Poem," was
published in the year 1705, and has already (thanks
to the British Museum, which like the nets of fishermen
receiveth of "all sorts") endowed with a century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and a half of posthumous renown; and no one can
deny that so much fame is due, both to the man who
bought, and the scribbler who sold the following
strain:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Whilst Britain's Sovereign scales such worth has weighed,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Anne herself her smiling favours paid,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That sacred hand does your fair chaplet twist,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Great Reade her own entitled Oculist,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With this fair mark of honour, sir, assume<br></span>
<span class="i0">No common trophies from this shining plume;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her favours by desert are only shared—<br></span>
<span class="i0">Her smiles are not her gift, but her reward.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thus in your new fair plumes of Honour drest,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To hail the Royal Foundress of the feast;<br></span>
<span class="i0">When the great Anne's warm smiles this favourite raise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis not a royal grace she gives, but pays."</span>
</div>

<p>Queen Anne's other "sworn oculist," as he and
Reade termed themselves, was Roger Grant, a cobbler
and Anabaptist preacher. He was a prodigiously vain
man, even for a quack, and had his likeness engraved
in copper. Impressions of the plate were distributed
amongst his friends, but were not in all cases treated
with much respect; for one of those who had been
complimented with a present of the eminent oculist's
portrait, fixed it on a wall of his house, having first
adorned it with the following lines:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"See here a picture of a brazen face,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The fittest lumber of this wretched place.<br></span>
<span class="i0">A tinker first his scene of life began;<br></span>
<span class="i0">That failing, he set up for cunning man;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But wanting luck, puts on a new disguise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And now pretends that he can mend your eyes;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But this expect, that, like a tinker true,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where he repairs one eye he puts out two."</span>
</div>

<p>The charge of his being a tinker was preferred
against him also by another lampoon writer. "In his
stead up popped Roger Grant, the tinker, of whom a
friend of mine once sung.—</p>

<div class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"'Her Majesty sure was in a surprise,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Or else was very short-sighted;<br></span>
<span class="i0">When a tinker was sworn to look after her eyes,<br></span>
<span class="i1">And the mountebank Reade was knighted.'"</span>
</div>

<p>This man, according to the custom of his class, was
in the habit of publishing circumstantial and minute
accounts of his cures. Of course his statements were
a tissue of untruths, with just the faintest possible
admixture of what was not altogether false. His plan
was to get hold of some poor person of imperfect vision,
and, after treating him with medicines and half-crowns
for six weeks, induce him to sign a testimonial
to the effect that he had been born stone-blind,
and had never enjoyed any visual power whatever,
till Providence led him to good Dr. Grant, who had
cured him in little more than a month. This certificate
the clergyman and churchwardens of the parish,
in which the patient had been known to wander about
the streets in mendicancy, were asked to attest; and
if they proved impregnable to the cunning representations
of the importunate suitors, and declined to
give the evidence of their handwriting, either on the
ground that they had reason to question the fact of
the original blindness, or because they were not thoroughly
acquainted with the particulars of the case,
Dr. Grant did not scruple to sign their names himself,
or by the hands of his agents. The <i>modus operandi</i>
with which he carried out these frauds may be learned
by the curious in a pamphlet, published in the year
1709, and entitled "A Full and True Account of a
Miraculous Cure of a Young Man in Newington that
was Born Blind."</p>

<p>But the last century was rife with medical quacks.
The Rev. John Hancocke, D.D., Rector of St. Margaret's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Lothbury, London, Prebendary of Canterbury,
and chaplain to the Duke of Bedford, preached
up the water-cure, which Pliny the naturalist described
as being in his day the fashionable remedy in
Rome. He published a work in 1723 that immediately
became popular, called "Febrifugum Magnum; or,
Common Water the best Cure for Fevers, and probably
for the Plague."</p>

<p>The good man deemed himself a genius of the highest
order, because he had discovered that a draught
of cold water, under certain circumstances, is a powerful
diaphoretic. His pharmacopeia, however, contained
another remedy—namely, stewed prunes, which
the Doctor regarded as a specific in obstinate cases
of blood-spitting. Then there was Ward, with his famous
pill, whose praises that learned man, Lord Chief
Baron Reynolds, sounded in every direction. There
was also a tar-water mania, which mastered the clear
intellect of Henry Fielding, and had as its principal
advocate the supreme intellect of the age, Bishop
Berkeley. In volume eighteen of the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> is a list of the quack-doctors then practising;
and the number of those named in it is almost as
numerous as the nostrums, which mount up to 202.
These accommodating fellows were ready to fleece every
rank of society. The fashionable impostor sold
his specific sometimes at the rate of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a pill, while
the humbler knave vended his boluses at 6<i>d.</i> a box.
To account for society tolerating, and yet more, warmly
encouraging such a state of things, we must remember
the force of the example set by eminent physicians
in vending medicines the composition of which they
kept secret. Sir Hans Sloane sold an eye-salve; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Dr. Mead had a favourite nostrum—a powder for the
bite of a mad dog.</p>

<p>The close of the seventeenth century was not in
respect of its quacks behind the few preceding generations.
In 1789 Mr. and Mrs. Loutherbourg became
notorious for curing people without medicine. God,
they proclaimed, had endowed them with a miraculous
power of healing the impoverished sick, by looking
upon them and touching them. Of course every
one who presumed to doubt the statement was regarded
as calling in question the miracles of holy
writ, and was exclaimed against as an infidel. The
doctor's house was besieged with enormous crowds.
The good man and his lady refused to take any fee
whatever, and issued gratuitous tickets amongst the
mob, which would admit the bearers into the Loutherbourgian
presence. Strange to say, however, these
tickets found their way into the hands of venal people,
who sold them to others in the crowd (who were tired
of waiting) for sums varying from two to five guineas
each; and ere long it was discovered that these barterers
of the healing power were accomplices in the
pay of the poor man's friend. A certain Miss Mary
Pratt, in all probability a puppet acting in obedience
to Loutherbourg's instructions, wrote an account of
the cures performed by the physician and his wife.
In a dedicatory letter to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
Miss Pratt says:—"I therefore presume when
these testimonies are searched into (which will corroborate
with mine) your Lordship will compose a
form of prayer, to be used in all churches and chapels,
that nothing may impede or prevent this inestimable
gift from having its free course; and publick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
thanks may be offered up in all churches and chapels,
for such an astonishing proof of God's love to this
favoured land." The publication frankly states that
"Mr. De Loutherbourg, who lives on Hammersmith
Green, has received a most glorious power from the
Lord Jehovah—viz. the gift of healing all manner of
diseases incident to the human body, such as blindness,
deafness, lameness, cancers, loss of speech, palsies."
But the statements of "cases" are yet more
droll. The reader will enjoy the perusal of a few of
them.</p>

<p>"<i>Case of Thomas Robinson.</i>—Thomas Robinson was
sent home to his parents at the sign of the Ram, a public-house
in Cow Cross, so ill with what is called the
king's evil, that they applied for leave to bring him
into St Bartholomew's Hospital." (Of course he
was discharged as "incurable," and was eventually
restored to health by Mr. Loutherbourg.) "But
how," continues Miss Pratt, "shall my pen paint ingratitude?
The mother had procured a ticket for
him from the Finsbury Dispensary, and with a shameful
reluctance denied having seen Mr De Loutherbourg,
waited on the kind gentleman belonging to
the dispensary, and, <i>amazing</i>! thanked them for relief
which they had no hand in; for she told me and fifty
more, she took the drugs and medicines and threw
them away, reserving the phials, &amp;c. Such an imposition
on the public ought to be detected, as she deprived
other poor people of those medicines which
might have been useful; not only so—robbed the Lord
of Life of the glory due to him only, by returning
thanks at the dispensary for a cure which they had
never performed. The lad is now under Mr De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Loutherbourg's care, who administered to him before
me yesterday in the public healing-room, amongst
a large concourse of people, amongst whom was some
of the first families in the kingdom."</p>

<p>"<i>Case.—Mary Ann Hughes.</i>—Her father is chairman
to her Grace the Duchess of Rutland, who lives at
No. 37, in Ogle Street. She had a most violent fever,
<i>fell into her knee</i>, went to Middlesex Hospital, where
they made every experiment in order to cure her—but
in vain; she came home worse than she went in,
her leg contracted and useless. In this deplorable
state she waited on Mrs De Loutherbourg, who, with
infinite condescension, saw her, administered to her,
and the second time of waiting on Mrs De Loutherbourg
she was perfectly cured."</p>

<p>"<i>Case.—Mrs Hook.</i>—Mrs Hook, Stableyard, St
James's, has two daughters born deaf and dumb. She
waited on the lady above-mentioned, <i>who looked on
them with an eye of benignity, and healed them</i>. (I
heard them both speak.)"</p>

<p>Mary Pratt, after enumerating several cases like the
foregoing, concludes thus:</p>

<p>"Let me repeat, with horror and detestation, the
wickedness of those who have procured tickets of admission,
and sold them for five and two guineas apiece!—whereas
this gift was chiefly intended for
the poor. Therefore Mr De Loutherbourg has retired
from the practice into the country (for the present),
having suffered all the indignities and contumely
that man could suffer, joined to ungrateful behaviour,
and tumultuous proceedings. I have heard people
curse him and threaten his life, instead of returning
him thanks; and it is my humble wish that prayers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
may be put up in all churches for his great gifts to
multiply."</p>


<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Finis.</span></p>

<p>"Report says three thousand persons have waited
for tickets at a time."</p>

<p>Forming a portion of this interesting work by Miss
Pratt is a description of a case which throws the
Loutherbourgian miracles into the shade, and is apparently
cited only for the insight it affords into the
state of public feeling in Queen Anne's time, as contrasted
with the sceptical enlightenment of George
III.'s reign:—</p>

<p>"I hope the public will allow me to adduce a case
which history will evince the truth of. A girl, whose
father and mother were French refugees, had her hip
dislocated from her birth. She was apprentice to a
milliner, and obliged to go out about the mistress's
business; the boys used to insult her for her lameness
continually, as she limped very much....
Providence directed her to read one of the miracles
performed by our blessed Saviour concerning the
withered arm. The girl exclaimed, 'Oh, madam, was
Jesus here on earth he would cure me.' Her mistress
answered, 'If you have faith, his power is the same
now.' She immediately cried, 'I have faith!' and
the bone flew into its place with a report like the noise
of a pistol. The girl's joy was ecstatic. She jumped
about the room in raptures. The servant was called,
sent for her parents, and the minister under whom
she sat. They spent the night praising God. Hundreds
came to see her, amongst whom was the Bishop
of London, by the command of her Majesty Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Anne (for in those days people were astonished at
this great miracle.)"</p>

<p>Dr. Loutherbourg was not the first quack to fleece
the good people of Hammersmith. In the 572nd
paper of the <i>Spectator</i>, dated July 26, 1714, there is
a good story of a consummate artist, who surrounded
himself with an enormous crowd, and assured them
that Hammersmith was the place of his nativity; and
that, out of strong natural affection for his birth-place,
he was willing to give each of its inhabitants a
present of five shillings. After this exordium, the
benevolent fellow produced from his cases an immense
number of packets of a powder warranted to
cure everything and kill nothing. The price of each
packet was properly five shillings and sixpence; but
out of love for the people of Hammersmith the good
doctor offered to let any of his audience buy them at
the rate of sixpence apiece. The multitude availed
themselves of this proposition to such an extent that it
is to be feared the friend of Hammersmith's humanity
suffered greatly from his liberality.</p>

<p>Steele has transmitted to us some capital anecdotes
of the empirics of his day. One doctor of Sir Richard's
acquaintance resided in Moore Alley, near
Wapping, and proclaimed his ability to cure cataracts,
<i>because he had lost an eye in the emperor's
service</i>. To his patients he was in the habit of displaying,
as a conclusive proof of his surgical prowess,
a muster-roll showing that either he, or a man of his
name, had been in one of his imperial Majesty's regiments.
At the sight of this document of course mistrust
fled. Another man professed to treat ruptured
children, because his father and grandfather were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
born bursten. But more humorous even than either
of these gentlemen was another friend of Sir Richard's,
who announced to the public that "from eight
to twelve and from two till six, he attended for the
good of the public to bleed for threepence."</p>

<p>The fortunes which pretenders to the healing art
have amassed would justify a belief that empiricism,
under favourable circumstances, is the best trade to
be found in the entire list of industrial occupations.
Quacks have in all ages found staunch supporters
amongst the powerful and affluent. Dr. Myersbach,
whom Lettsom endeavoured to drive back into obscurity,
continued, long after the publication of the
"Observations," to make a large income out of the
credulity of the fashionable classes of English society.
Without learning of any kind, this man raised himself
to opulence. His degree was bought at Erfurth for
a few shillings, just before that university raised the
prices of its academical distinctions, in consequence
of the pleasant raillery of a young Englishman, who
paid the fees for a Doctor's diploma, and had it duly
recorded in the Collegiate archives as having been
presented to Anglicus Ponto; Ponto being no other
than his mastiff dog. With such a degree Myersbach
set up for a philosopher. Patients crowded to his
consulting-room, and those who were unable to come
sent their servants with descriptions of their cases.
But his success was less than that of the inventor of
Ailhaud's powders, which ran their devastating
course through every country in Europe, sending to
the silence of the grave almost as many thousands as
were destroyed in all Napoleon's campaigns. Tissot,
in his "Avis au Peuple," published in 1803, attacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Ailhaud with characteristic vehemence, and put an
end to his destructive power; but ere this took place
the charlatan had mounted on his slaughtered
myriads to the possession of three baronies, and was
figuring in European courts as the Baron de Castelet.</p>

<p>The tricks which these practitioners have had recourse
to for the attainment of their ends are various.
Dr. Katterfelto, who rose into eminence upon the evil
wind that brought the influenza to England in the
year 1782, always travelled about the country in a
large caravan, containing a number of black cats.
This gentleman's triumphant campaign was brought
to a disastrous termination by the mayor of Shrewsbury,
who gave him a taste of the sharp discipline
provided at that time by the law for rogues and
vagabonds.—"The Wise Man of Liverpool," whose
destiny it was to gull the canny inhabitants of the
North of England, used to traverse the country in a
chariot drawn by six horses, attended by a perfect
army of outriders in brilliant liveries, and affecting
all the pomp of a prince of the royal blood.</p>

<p>The quacks who merit severe punishment the least
of all their order are those who, while they profess
to exercise a powerful influence over the bodies of
their patients, leave nature to pursue her operations
pretty much in her own way. Of this comparatively
harmless class was Atwell, the parson of St. Tue, who,
according to the account given of him by Fuller, in
his English Worthies, "although he now and then
used blood-letting, mostly for all diseases prescribed
milk, and often milk and apples, which (although
contrary to the judgments of the best-esteemed
practitioners) either by virtue of the medicine, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
fortune of the physician, or fancy of the patient, recovered
many out of desperate extremities." Atwell
won his reputation by acting on the same principle
that has brought a certain degree of popularity to the
homœopathists—that, namely, of letting things run
their own course. The higher order of empirics have
always availed themselves of the wonderful faculty
possessed by nature of taking good care of herself.
Simple people who enlarge on the series of miraculous
cures performed by their pet charlatan, and find in
them proofs of his honesty and professional worth, do
not reflect that in ninety-and-nine cases out of every
hundred where a sick person is restored to health, the
result is achieved by nature rather than art, and
would have been arrived at as speedily without as
with medicine. Again, the fame of an ordinary
medical practitioner is never backed up by simple
and compound addition. His cures and half cures
are never summed up to magnificent total by his employers,
and then flaunted about on a bright banner
before the eyes of the electors. 'Tis a mere matter
of course that <i>he</i> (although he <i>is</i> quite wrong, and
knows not half as much about his art as any great
lady who has tested the efficacy of the new system on
her sick poodle) should cure people. 'Tis only the
cause of globules which is to be supported by documentary
evidence, containing the case of every young
lady who has lost a severe headache under the benign
influence of an infinitesimal dose of flour and water.</p>

<p>Dumoulin, the physician, observed at his death
that "he left behind him two great physicians, Regimen
and River Water." A due appreciation of the
truth embodied in this remark, coupled with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
masterly assurance, without which the human family
is not to be fleeced, enabled the French quack, Villars,
to do good to others and to himself at the same time.
This man, in 1723, confided to his friends that his
uncle, who had recently been killed by an accident at
the advanced age of one hundred years, had bequeathed
to him the recipe for a nostrum which would
prolong the life of any one who used it to a hundred
and fifty, provided only that the rules of sobriety
were never transgressed. Whenever a funeral passed
him in the street he said aloud, "Ah! if that unfortunate
creature had taken my nostrum, he might be
carrying that coffin, instead of being carried in it."
This nostrum was composed of nitre and Seine water,
and was sold at the ridiculously cheap rate of five
francs a bottle. Those who bought it were directed to
drink it at certain stated periods, and also to lead regular
lives, to eat moderately, drink temperately, take
plenty of bodily exercise, go to and rise from bed
early, and to avoid mental anxiety. In an enormous
majority of cases the patient was either cured or benefitted.
Some possibly died, who, by the ministrations
of science, might have been preserved from the grave.
But in these cases, and doubtless they were few, the
blunder was set down to Nature, who, somewhat unjustly,
was never credited with any of the recoveries.
The world was charitable, and the doctor could say—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The grave my faults does hide,<br></span>
<span class="i1">The world my cures does see;<br></span>
<span class="i0">What youth and time provide,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Are oft ascribed to me."</span>
</div>

<p>Anyhow Villars succeeded, and won the approbation
not only of his dupes, but of those also who were
sagacious enough to see the nature of his trick. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Abbe Pons declared him to be the superior of the marshal
of the same name. "The latter," said he, "kills
men—the former prolongs their existence." At length
Villars' secret leaked out; and his patients, unwise in
coming to him, unwisely deserted him. His occupation
was gone.</p>

<p>The displeasure of Villars' dupes, on the discovery
of the benevolent hoax played upon them, reminds
us of a good story. Some years since, at a fashionable
watering-place, on the south-east coast of England,
resided a young surgeon—handsome, well-bred,
and of most pleasant address. He was fast rising
into public favour and a good practice, when an eccentric
and wealthy maiden lady, far advanced in years,
sent for him. The summons of course was promptly
obeyed, and the young practitioner was soon listening
to a most terrible story of suffering. The afflicted
lady, according to her own account, had a year before,
during the performance of her toilet, accidentally
taken into her throat one of the bristles of her tooth-brush.
This bristle had stuck in the top of the gullet,
and set up an irritation which, she was convinced,
was killing her. She had been from one surgeon of
eminence to another, and everywhere in London and
in the country the Faculty had assured her that she
was only the victim of a nervous delusion—that her
throat was in a perfectly healthy condition—that the
disturbance existed only in her own imagination.
"And so they go on, the stupid, obstinate, perverse,
unfeeling creatures," concluded the poor lady, "saying
there is nothing the matter with me, while I am—dying—dying—dying!"
"Allow me, my dear lady,"
said the adroit surgeon in reply, "to inspect for myself—carefully—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
state of your throat." The inspection
was made gravely, and at much length. "My
dear Miss ——," resumed the surgeon, when he had
concluded his examination, "you are quite right, and
Sir Benjamin Brodie and Sir James Clark are wrong.
I can see the head of the bristle low down, almost out
of sight; and if you'll let me run home for my instruments,
I'll forthwith extract it for you." The adroit
man retired, and in a few minutes re-entered the
room, armed with a very delicate pair of forceps, into
the teeth of which he had inserted a bristle taken
from an ordinary tooth-brush. The rest can be
imagined. The lady threw back her head; the forceps
were introduced into her mouth; a prick—a scream!
and 'twas all over; and the surgeon, with a smiling
face, was holding up to the light, and inspecting with
lively curiosity, the extracted bristle. The patient
was in raptures at a result that proved that she was
right, and Sir Benjamin Brodie wrong. She immediately
recovered her health and spirits, and went
about everywhere sounding the praises of "her
saviour," as she persisted in calling the dexterous
operator. So enthusiastic was her gratitude, she
offered him her hand in marriage and her noble
fortune. The fact that the young surgeon was already
married was an insuperable obstacle to this arrangement.
But other proofs of gratitude the lady
lavishly showered on him. She compelled him to
accept a carriage and horses, a service of plate, and a
new house. Unfortunately the lucky fellow could not
keep his own counsel. Like foolish Samson with
Delilah, he imparted the secret of his cunning to the
wife of his bosom; she confided it to Louise Clarissa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
her especial friend, who had been her bridesmaid;
Louise Clarissa told it under vows of inviolable
secrecy to six other particular friends; and the six
other particular friends—base and unworthy girls!—told
it to all the world. Ere long the story came
round to the lady herself. Then what a storm arose!
She was in a transport of fury! It was of no avail
for the surgeon to remind her that he had unquestionably
raised her from a pitiable condition to health
and happiness. That mattered not. He had tricked,
fooled, bamboozled her! She would not forgive him,
she would pursue him with undying vengeance, she
would ruin him! The writer of these pages is happy
to know that the surgeon here spoken of, whose prosperous
career has been adorned by much genuine
benevolence, though unforgiven, was not ruined.</p>

<p>The ignorant are remarkable alike for suspicion
and credulity; and the quack makes them his prey by
lulling to sleep the former quality, and artfully arousing
and playing upon the latter. Whatever the field
of quackery may be, the dupe must ever be the same.
Some years since a canny drover, from the north of
the Tweed, gained a high reputation throughout the
Eastern Counties for selling at high prices the beasts
intrusted to him as a salesman. At Norwich and
Earl Soham, at Bury and Ipswich, the story was the
same—Peter M'Dougal invariably got more per head
for "a lot" than even his warmest admirers had
calculated he would obtain. He managed his business
so well, that his brethren, unable to compete with
him, came to a conclusion not altogether supported by
the facts of the case, but flattering to their own self-love.
Clearly Peter could only surpass them by such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
a long distance, through the agency of some charm
or witch's secret. They hinted as much; and Peter
wisely accepted the suggestion, with a half-assenting
nod of cunning, and encouraged his mates to believe
in it. A year or so passed on, and it was generally
allowed that Peter M'Dougal was in league on honourable
terms with the unseen world. To contend
with him was useless. The only line open to his
would-be imitators was to buy from him participations
in his mysterious powers. "Peter," at length
said a simple southern, at the close of Halesworth
cattle-fair, acting as spokesman for himself and four
other conspirators, "lets us into yer secret, man.
Yer ha' made here twelve pun a yead by a lot that
aren't woth sex. How ded yer doo it? We are all
owld friens. Lets us goo to 'Th' Alter'd Case,' an I
an my mets ull stan yar supper an a dead drunk o'
whiskey or rom poonch, so be yar jine hans to giv us
the wink." Peter's eyes twinkled. He liked a good
supper and plenty of hot grog at a friend's expense.
Indeed, of such fare, like Sheridan with wine, he was
ready to take any given quantity. The bargain was
made, and an immediate adjournment effected to the
public-house rejoicing in the title of "The Case is
Altered." The supper was of hot steak-pudding,
made savoury with pepper and onions. Peter
M'Dougal ate plentifully and deliberately. Slowly
also he drank two stiff tumblers of whiskey punch,
smoking his pipe meanwhile without uttering a word.
The second tumbler was followed by a third, and as he
sipped the latter half of it, his entertainers closed
round him, and intimated that their part of the contract
being accomplished, he, as a man of honour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
ought to fulfill his. Peter was a man of few words,
and without any unnecessary prelude or comment, he
stated in one laconic speech the secret of his professional
success. Laying down his pipe by his empty
glass, and emitting from his gray eyes a light of
strange humour, he said drily, "Ye'd knoo hoo it was
I cam to mak sae guid a sale o' my beasties? Weel,
I ken it was joost this—<i>I fund a fule!</i>"</p>

<p>The drover who rises to be a capitalist, and the
lawyer who mounts to the woolsack, ascend by the
same process. They know how to find out fools, and
how to turn their discoveries to advantage.</p>

<p>It is told of a Barbadoes physician and slaveholder,
that having been robbed to a serious extent in his
sugar-works, he discovered the thief by the following
ingenious artifice. Having called his slaves together,
he addressed them thus:—"My friends, the great
serpent appeared to me during the night, and told
me that the person who stole my money should, at this
instant—<i>this very instant</i>—have a parrot's feather
at the point of his nose." On this announcement, the
dishonest thief, anxious to find out if his guilt had
declared itself, put his finger to his nose. "Man,"
cried the master instantly, "'tis thou who hast
robbed me. The great serpent has just told me so."</p>

<p>Clearly this piece of quackery succeeded, because
the quack had "fund a fule."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>JOHN RADCLIFFE.</h3>


<p>Radcliffe, the Jacobite partisan, the physician without
learning, and the luxurious <i>bon-vivant</i>, who
grudged the odd sixpences of his tavern scores, was
born at Wakefield in Yorkshire, in the year 1650.
His extraction was humble, his father being only a
well-to-do yeoman. In after life, when he lived on
intimate terms with the leading nobility of the
country, he put in a claim for aristocratic descent;
and the Earl of Derwentwater recognized him as a
kinsman deriving his blood from the Radcliffes of
Dilston, in the county of Northumberland, the chiefs
of which honourable family had been knights, barons,
and earls, from the time of Henry IV. It may be remembered
that a similar countenance was given to
Burke's patrician pretensions, which have been related
by more than one biographer, with much
humorous pomp. In Radcliffe's case the Heralds interfered
with the Earl's decision; for after the physician's
decease they admonished the University of
Oxford not to erect any escutcheon over or upon his
monument. But though Radcliffe was a plebeian, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
contrived, by his shrewd humour, arrogant simplicity,
and immeasurable insolence, to hold both Whigs and
Tories in his grasp. The two factions of the aristocracy
bowed before him—the Tories from affection to
a zealous adherent of regal absolutism; and the
Whigs, from a superstitious belief in his remedial
skill, and a fear that in their hours of need he would
leave them to the advances of Death.</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen he became a member of the
University College, Oxford; and having kept his
terms there, he took his B. A. degree in 1669, and was
made senior-scholar of the college. But no fellowship
falling vacant there, he accepted one on the
foundation of Lincoln College. His M. B. degree he
took in 1675, and forthwith obtained considerable
practice in Oxford. Owing to a misunderstanding
with Dr. Marshall, the rector of Lincoln College, Radcliffe
relinquished a fellowship, which he could no
longer hold, without taking orders, in 1677. He did
not take his M. D. degree till 1682, two years after
which time he went up to London, and took a house in
Bow Street, next that in which Sir Godfrey Kneller
long resided; and with a facility which can hardly be
credited in these days, when success is achieved only
by slow advances, he stept forthwith into a magnificent
income.</p>

<p>The days of mealy-mouthed suavity had not yet
come to the Faculty. Instead of standing by each
other with lip-service, as they now do in spite of all
their jealousies, physicians and surgeons vented their
mutual enmities in frank, honest abuse. Radcliffe's
tongue was well suited for this part of his business;
and if that unruly member created for him enemies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
it could also contend with a legion of adversaries at
the same time. Foulks and Adams, then the first
apothecaries in Oxford, tried to discredit the young
doctor, but were ere long compelled to sue for a cessation
of hostilities. Luff, who afterwards became
Professor of Physic in the University, declared that
all "Radcliffe's cures were performed only by guesswork";
and Gibbons, with a sneer, said, "that it was
a pity that his friends had not made a scholar of the
young man." In return Radcliffe always persisted
in speaking of his opponent as <i>Nurse</i> Gibbons—because
of his slops and diet drinks, whereas he (Radcliffe
the innovator) preached up the good effects of
fresh air, a liberal table, and cordials. This was the
Dr. Gibbons around whom the apothecaries rallied, to
defend their interests in the great Dispensarian contest,
and whom Garth in his poem ridicules, under the
name of "Mirmillo," for entertaining drug-venders:—</p>

</div>

<p>Gibbons was not the only dangerous antagonist that
Radcliffe did battle with in London. Dr. Whistler,
Sir Edmund King, Sir Edward Hannes, and Sir
Richard Blackmore were all strong enough to hurt
him and rouse his jealousy. Hannes, also an Oxford
man, was to the last a dangerous and hated rival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
He opened his campaign in London with a carriage
and four horses. The equipage was so costly and
imposing that it attracted the general attention of
the town. "By Jove! Radcliffe," said a kind friend,
"Hannes's horses are the finest I have ever seen."
"Umph!" growled Radcliffe savagely, "then he'll be
able to sell them for all the more."</p>

<p>To make his name known Hannes used to send his
liveried footmen running about the streets with directions
to put their heads into every coach they met
and inquire, with accents of alarm, if Dr. Hannes was
in it. Acting on these orders, one of his fellows, after
looking into every carriage between Whitehall and
the Royal Exchange, without finding his employer,
ran up Exchange Alley into Garraway's Coffee-house,
which was one of the great places of meeting for the
members of the medical profession. (Apothecaries
used regularly to come and consult the physicians,
while the latter were over their wine, paying only
half fees for the advice so given, without the patients
being personally examined. Batson's coffee-house in
Corn-hill was another favourite spot for these Galenic
re-unions, Sir William Blizard being amongst the last
of the medical authorities who frequented that hostelry
for the purpose of receiving apothecaries.)
"Gentlemen, can your honours tell me if Dr. Hannes
is here?" asked the man, running into the very centre
of the exchange of medicine-men. "Who wants Dr.
Hannes, fellow?" demanded Radcliffe, who happened
to be present. "Lord A—— and Lord B——, your
honour!" answered the man. "No, no, friend," responded
the doctor slowly, and with pleasant irony,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
"you are mistaken. Those lords don't want your
master—'tis he who wants them."</p>

<p>But Hannes made friends and a fine income, to the
deep chagrin of his contemptuous opponent. An incessant
feud existed between the two men. The virulence
of their mutual animosity may be estimated by
the following story. When the poor little Duke of
Gloucester was taken ill, Sir Edward Hannes and
Blackmore (famous as Sir Richard Blackmore, the
poet) were called in to attend him. On the case taking
a fatal turn, Radcliffe was sent for; and after
roundly charging the two doctors with the grossest
mismanagement of a simple attack of rash, went on,
"It would have been happy for this nation had you,
sir, been bred up a basket-maker—and you, sir, had
remained a country schoolmaster, rather than have
ventured out of your reach, in the practice of an art
which you are an utter stranger to, and for your
blunders in which you ought to be whipped with one
of your own rods." The reader will not see the force
of this delicate speech if he is not aware that Hannes
was generally believed to be the son of a basket-maker,
and Sir Richard Blackmore had, in the period
of his early poverty, like Johnson and Oliver Goldsmith,
been a teacher of boys. Whenever the "Amenities
of the Faculty" come to be published, this consultation,
on the last illness of Jenkin Lewis's little
friend, ought to have its niche in the collection.</p>

<p>Towards the conclusion of his life, Radcliffe said
that, "when a young practitioner, he possessed
twenty remedies for every disease; and at the close
of his career he found twenty diseases for which he
had not one remedy." His mode of practice, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
as far as anything is known about it, at the
outset was the same as that which he used at the conclusion
of his career. Pure air, cleanliness, and a
wholesome diet were amongst his most important prescriptions;
though he was so far from running counter
to the interests of the druggists, that his apothecary,
Dandridge, whose business was almost entirely
confined to preparing the doctor's medicines, died
worth 50,000<i>l</i>. For the imaginary maladies of his
hypochondriacal male and fanciful female patients
he had the greatest contempt, and neither respect
for age or rank, nor considerations of interest, could
always restrain him from insulting such patients.
In 1686 he was appointed physician to Princess Anne
of Denmark, and was for some years a trusted adviser
of that royal lady; but he lacked the compliant
temper and imperturbable suavity requisite for a
court physician. Shortly after the death of Queen
Mary, the Princess Anne, having incurred a fit of
what is by the vulgar termed "blue devils," from
not paying proper attention to her diet, sent in all
haste to her physician. Radcliffe, when he received
the imperative summons to hurry to St. James's was
sitting over his bottle in a tavern. The allurements
of Bacchus were too strong for him, and he delayed
his visit to the distinguished sufferer. A second messenger
arrived, but by that time the physician was so
gloriously ennobled with claret, that he discarded all
petty considerations of personal advantage, and flatly
refused to stir an inch from the room where he was
experiencing all the happiness humanity is capable
of. "Tell her Royal Highness," he exclaimed, banging
his fist on the table, "that her distemper is nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
but the vapours. She's in as good state of health
as any woman breathing—only she can't make up
her mind to believe it."</p>

<p>The next morning prudence returned with sobriety;
and the doctor did not fail to present himself
at an early hour in the Princess's apartment in St.
James's Palace. To his consternation he was stopped
in the ante-room by an officer, and informed that he
was dismissed from his post, which had already been
given to Dr. Gibbons. Anne never forgave the sarcasm
about "the vapours." It so rankled in her
breast, that, though she consented to ask for the Doctor's
advice both for herself and those dear to her,
she never again held any cordial communication with
him. Radcliffe tried to hide the annoyance caused
him by his fall, in a hurricane of insolence towards
his triumphant rival: Nurse Gibbons had gotten a
new nursery—Nurse Gibbons was not to be envied
his new acquisition—Nurse Gibbons was fit only to
look after a woman who merely fancied herself ill.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this rupture with the Court, Radcliffe
continued to have the most lucrative practice
in town, and in all that regarded money he was from
first to last a most lucky man. On coming to town
he found Lower, the Whig physician, sinking in public
favour—and Thomas Short, the Roman Catholic
doctor, about to drop into the grave. Whistler, Sir
Edmund King, and Blackmore had plenty of patients.
But there was a "splendid opening," and so
cleverly did Radcliffe slip into it, that at the end of
his first year in town he got twenty guineas per diem.
The difference in the value of money being taken
into consideration, it may be safely affirmed that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
living physician makes more. Occasionally the fees
presented to him were very large. He cured Bentinck,
afterwards Earl of Portland, of a diarrhœa,
and Zulestein, afterwards Earl of Rochford, of an
attack of congestion of the brain. For these services
William III. presented him with 500 guineas out of
the privy-purse, and offered to appoint him one of
his physicians, with £200 per annum more than he
gave any other of his medical officers. Radcliffe
pocketed the fee, but his Jacobite principles precluded
him from accepting the post. William, however,
notwithstanding the opposition of Bidloe and
the rest of his medical servants, held Radcliffe in
such estimation that he continually consulted him;
and during the first eleven years of his reign paid
him, one year with another, 600 guineas per annum.
And when he restored to health William, Duke of
Gloucester (the Princess of Denmark's son), who in
his third year was attacked with severe convulsions,
Queen Mary sent him, through the hand of her Lord
Chamberlain, 1000 guineas. And for attending the
Earl of Albemarle at Namur he had 400 guineas and
a diamond ring, 1200 guineas from the treasury, and
an offer of a baronetcy from the King.</p>

<p>For many years he was the neighbour of Sir Godfrey
Kneller, in Bow Street. A dispute that occurred
between the two neighbours and friends is worth
recording. Sir Godfrey took pleasure in his garden,
and expended large sums of money in stocking it with
exotic plants and rare flowers. Radcliffe also enjoyed
a garden, but loved his fees too well to expend them
on one of his own. He suggested to Sir Godfrey
that it would be a good plan to insert a door into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
boundary wall between their gardens, so that on idle
afternoons, when he had no patients to visit, he might
slip into his dear friend's pleasure-grounds. Kneller
readily assented to this proposition, and ere a week
had elapsed the door was ready for use. The plan,
however, had not been long acted on when the painter
was annoyed by Radcliffe's servants wantonly injuring
his parterres. After fruitlessly expostulating
against these depredations, the sufferer sent a message
to his friend, threatening, if the annoyance recurred,
to brick up the wall. "Tell Sir Godfrey,"
answered Radcliffe to the messenger, "that he may
do what he likes to the door, so long as he does not
paint it." When this vulgar jeer was reported to
Kneller, he replied, with equal good humour and
more wit, "Go back and give my service to Dr. Radcliffe,
and tell him, I'll take anything from him—but
physic."</p>

<p>Radcliffe was never married, and professed a degree
of misogyny that was scarcely in keeping with
his conduct on certain occasions. His person was
handsome and imposing, but his manners were little
calculated to please women. Overbearing, truculent,
and abusive, he could not rest without wounding the
feelings of his companions with harsh jokes. Men
could bear with him, but ladies were like Queen Anne
in vehemently disliking him. King William was not
pleased with his brutal candour in exclaiming, at the
sight of the dropsical ancles uncovered for inspection,
"I would not have your Majesty's legs for your
three kingdoms"; but William's sister-in-law repaid
a much slighter offence with life-long animosity. In
1693, however, the doctor made an offer to a citizen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
daughter, who had beauty and a fortune of £15,000.
As she was only twenty-four years of age, the doctor
was warmly congratulated by his friends when he informed
them that he, though well advanced in middle
age, had succeeded in his suit. Before the wedding-day,
however, it was discovered that the health of the
lady rendered it incumbent on her honour that she
should marry her father's book-keeper. This mishap
soured the doctor's temper to the fair sex, and his
sarcasms at feminine folly and frailty were innumerable.</p>

<p>He was fond of declaring that he wished for an
Act of Parliament entitling nurses to the sole and
entire medical care of women. A lady who consulted
him about a nervous singing in the head was advised
to "curl her hair with a ballad." His scorn of
women was not lessened by the advances of certain
disorderly ladies of condition, who displayed for him
that morbid passion which medical practitioners have
often to resist in the treatment of hysterical patients.
Yet he tried his luck once again at the table of love.
"There's no fool so great as an old fool." In the
summer of 1709, Radcliffe, then in his sixtieth year,
started a new equipage; and having arrayed himself
in the newest mode of foppery, threw all the town
into fits of laughter by paying his addresses, with
the greatest possible publicity, to a lady who possessed
every requisite charm—(youth, beauty,
wealth)—except a tenderness for her aged suitor.
Again was there an unlucky termination to the doctor's
love, which Steele, in No. 44 of <i>The Tatler</i>, ridiculed
in the following manner:—</p>

<p>"This day, passing through Covent Garden, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
stopped in the Piazza by Pacolet, to observe what
he called <i>The Triumph of Love and Youth</i>. I turned
to the object he pointed at, and there I saw a gay
gilt chariot, drawn by fresh prancing horses, the
coachman with a new cockade, and the lacqueys with
insolence and plenty in their countenances. I asked
immediately, 'What young heir, or lover, owned that
glittering equipage!' But my companion interrupted,
'Do not you see there the mourning
Æsculapius?' 'The mourning!' said I. 'Yes, Isaac,'
said Pacolet, 'he is in deep mourning, and is the
languishing, hopeless lover of the divine Hebe, the
emblem of Youth and Beauty. That excellent and
learned sage you behold in that furniture is the
strongest instance imaginable that love is the most
powerful of all things.</p>

<p>"'You are not so ignorant as to be a stranger to
the character of Æsculapius, as the patron and most
successful of all who profess the Art of Medicine.
But as most of his operations are owing to a natural
sagacity or impulse, he has very little troubled himself
with the Doctrine of Drugs, but has always given
Nature more room to help herself than any of her
learned assistants; and consequently has done greater
wonders than in the power of Art to perform; for
which reason he is half deified by the people, and
has ever been courted by all the world, just as if he
were a seventh son.</p>

<p>"'It happened that the charming Hebe was reduc'd,
by a long and violent fever, to the most extreme
danger of Death; and when all skill failed,
they sent for Æsculapius. The renowned artist was
touched with the deepest compassion, to see the faded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
charms and faint bloom of Hebe; and had a generous
concern, too, in beholding a struggle, not between
Life, but rather between Youth, and Death. All his
skill and his passion tended to the recovery of Hebe,
beautiful even in sickness; but, alas! the unhappy
physician knew not that in all his care he was only
sharpening darts for his own destruction. In a word,
his fortune was the same with that of the statuary
who fell in love with an image of his own making;
and the unfortunate Æsculapius is become the patient
of her whom he lately recovered. Long before
this, Æsculapius was far gone in the unnecessary and
superfluous amusements of old age, in the increase
of unwieldy stores, and the provision in the midst
of an incapacity of enjoyment, of what he had for a
supply of more wants than he had calls for in Youth
itself. But these low considerations are now no more;
and Love has taken place of Avarice, or rather is
become an Avarice of another kind, which still urges
him to pursue what he does not want. But behold
the metamorphosis: the anxious mean cares of an
usurer are turned into the languishments and complaints
of a lover. "Behold," says the aged
Æsculapius, "I submit; I own, great Love, thy empire.
Pity, Hebe, the fop you have made. What
have I to do with gilding but on Pills? Yet, O Fate!
for thee I sit amidst a crowd of painted deities on
my chariot, buttoned in gold, clasp'd in gold, without
having any value for that beloved metal, but as it
adorns the person and laces the hat of the dying lover.
I ask not to live, O Hebe! Give me but gentle death.
Euthanasia, Euthanasia! that is all I implore."'
When Æsculapius had finished his complaint, Pacolet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
went on in deep morals on the uncertainty of riches,
with this remarkable explanation—'O wealth! how
impatient art thou! And how little dost thou supply
us with real happiness, when the usurer himself cannot
forget thee, for the love of what is foreign to his
felicity, as thou art!'"</p>

<p>Seven days after the <i>Tatler</i> resumed the attack,
but with less happy effect. In this picture, the justice
of which was not questioned, even by the Doctor's
admirers, the avarice of the veteran is not less
insisted on as the basis of his character, than his
amorousness is displayed as a ludicrous freak of
vanity. Indeed, love of money was the master-defect
of Radcliffe's disposition. Without a child, or a
prospect of offspring, he screwed and scraped in
every direction. Even his debaucheries had an alloy
of discomfort that does not customarily mingle in the
dissipations of the rich. The flavour of the money
each bottle cost gave ungrateful smack to his wine.
He had numerous poor relations, of whom he took,
during his life, little or no notice. Even his sisters
he kept at arm's distance, lest they should show their
affection for him by dipping their hands in his pockets.
It is true, he provided liberally for them at his
death—leaving to the one (a married lady—Mrs.
Hannah Redshaw) a thousand a year for life, and to
the other (a spinster lady) an income of half that
amount as long as she lived. But that he treated
them with unbrotherly neglect there is no doubt.</p>

<p>After his decease, a letter was found in his closet,
directed to his unmarried sister, Millicent Radcliffe,
in which, with contrition, and much pathos, he bids
her farewell. "You will find," says he, in that epistle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
"by my will that I have taken better care of you
than perhaps you might expect from my former
treatment of you; for which, with my dying breath,
I most heartily ask pardon. I had indeed acted the
brother's part much better, in making a handsome
settlement on you while living, than after my decease;
and can plead nothing in excuse, but that the
love of money, which I have emphatically known to
be the root of all evil, was too predominant over me.
Though, I hope, I have made some amends for that
odious sin of covetousness, in my last dispositions of
those worldly goods which it pleased the great Dispenser
of Providence to bless me with."</p>

<p>What made this meanness of disposition in money
matters the more remarkable was, that he was capable
of occasional munificence, on a scale almost beyond
his wealth, and also of a stoical fortitude under any
reverse of fortune that chanced to deprive him of
some of his beloved guineas.</p>

<p>In the year 1704, at a general collection for propagating
the Gospel in foreign parts, he settled on
the Society established for that purpose £50 per
annum for ever. And this noble gift he unostentatiously
made under an assumed name. In the same
year he presented £520 to the Bishop of Norwich,
to be distributed among the poor non-juring clergy;
and this donation he also desired should be kept a
secret from the world.</p>

<p>His liberality to Oxford was far from being all of
the <i>post-mortem</i> sort. In 1687 he presented the
chapel of University College with an east window,
representing, in stained glass, the Nativity, and having
the following inscription:—"D.D. Johan Radcliffe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
M.D., hujus Collegii quondam Socius, Anno
Domini <small>MDCLXXXVII</small>." In 1707 he gave Sprat, Bishop
of Rochester, bills for £300, drawn under the assumed
name of Francis Andrews, on Waldegrave the goldsmith,
of Russell Street, Covent Garden, for the relief
of distressed Scotch Episcopal clergy.</p>

<p>As another instance of how his niggard nature
could allow him to do good by stealth, and blush to
find it fame, his liberality to James Drake, the Tory
writer, may be mentioned. Drake was a physician,
as well as a political author. As the latter, he was
well liked, as the former he was honestly hated by
Radcliffe. Two of a trade—where one of the two is
a John Radcliffe—can never agree. Each of the two
doctors had done his utmost to injure the reputation
of the other. But when Drake, broken in circumstances
by a political persecution, was in sore distress
from want of money, Radcliffe put fifty guineas
into a lady's hands, and begged her to convey it to
Drake. "Let him," said Radcliffe, with the delicacy
of a fine heart, "by no means be told whence it comes.
He is a gentleman, and has often done his best to
hurt me. He could, therefore, by no means brook
the receipt of a benefit from a person whom he had
used all possible means to make an enemy."</p>

<p>After such instances of Ratcliffe's generosity, it
may seem unnecessary to give more proofs of the existence
of that quality, disguised though it was by
miserly habits. His friend Nutley, a loose rollicking
gentleman about town, a barrister without practice,
a man of good family, and no fortune, a jovial dog,
with a jest always on his lips, wine in his head, and
a death's-head grinning over each shoulder [such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
bachelors may still be found in London], was in this
case the object of the doctor's benevolence. Driven
by duns and tippling to the borders of distraction,
Nutley crept out of his chambers under the cover of
night to the "Mitre Tavern," and called for "a bottle."
"A bottle" with Nutley meant "many bottles."
The end of it was that the high-spirited gentleman
fell down in a condition of —— well! in a
condition that Templars, in this age of earnest purpose
and decent morals, would blush to be caught in.
Mr. Nutley was taken hold of by the waiters, and
carried up-stairs to bed.</p>

<p>The next morning the merry fellow is in the saddest
of all possible humours. The memory of a few
little bills, the holders of which are holding a parliament
on his stair-case in Pump-court; the recollection
that he has not a guinea left—either to pacify those
creditors with, or to use in paying for the wine consumed
over night; a depressing sense that the prominent
features of civilized existence are tax-gatherers
and sheriff's officers; a head that seems to be falling
over one side of the pillow, whilst the eyes roll out
on the other;—all these afflict poor Mr. Nutley! A
knock at the door, and the landlady enters. The
landlady is the Widow Watts, daughter of the widow
Bowles, also in the same line. As now, so a hundred
and fifty years ago, ladies in licensed victualling circles
played tricks with their husbands' night-caps—killed
them with kindness, and reigned in their stead.
The widow Watts has a sneaking fondness for poor
Mr. Nutley, and is much affected when, in answer to
her inquiry how "his honour feels his-self," he begins
to sob like a child, narrate the troubles of his infancy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the errors of his youth, and the sorrows of his
riper age. Mistress Watts is alarmed. Only to think
of Mr. Nutley going on like that, talking of his blessed
mother who had been dead these twenty years, and
vowing he'd kill himself, because he is an outcast,
and no better than a disgrace to his family. "To
think of it! and only yesterday he were the top of
company, and would have me drink his own honourable
health in a glass of his own wine." Mistress
Watts sends straightway for Squire Nutley's friend,
the Doctor. When Radcliffe makes his appearance,
he sees the whole case at a glance, rallies Billy Nutley
about his rascally morals, estimates his assertion
that "it's only his liver a little out of order" exactly
at its worth, and takes his leave shortly, saying to
himself, "If poor Billy could only be freed from the
depression caused by his present pecuniary difficulties,
he would escape for this once a return of the
deliri...." At the end of another half hour, a
goldsmith's man enters the bed-room, and puts into
Nutley's hand a letter and a bag of gold containing
200 guineas. The epistle is from Radcliffe, begging
his friend to accept the money, and to allow
the donor to send him in a few days 300
more of the same coins. Such was the physician's
prescription, in dispensing which he condescended to
act as his own apothecary. Bravo, doctor!—who of
us shall say which of the good deeds—thy gift to
Billy Nutley or thy princely bequest to Oxford—has
the better right to be regarded as the offspring of
sincere benevolence? Some—and let no "fie!" be
cried upon them—will find in this story more to make
them love thy memory than they have ever found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
that noble library whose dome stands up amidst the
towers, and steeples, and sacred walls of beloved
Oxford.</p>

<p>It would not be hard to say which of the two gifts
has done the greater good. Poor Will Nutley took
his 500 guineas, and had "more bottles," went a few
more times to the theatres in lace and velvet and
brocade, roared out at a few more drinking bouts,
and was carried off by [his biographer calls it "a
violent fever"] in the twenty-ninth year of his age.
And possibly since Willy Nutley was Willy Nutley,
and no one else, this was the best possible termination
for him. That Radcliffe, the head of a grave
profession, and a man of fifty-seven years of age,
should have conceived an enthusiastic friendship for
a youngster of half his age, is a fact that shows us
one of the consequences of the tavern life of our
great-grandfathers. It puts us in mind of how Fielding,
ere he had a beard, burst into popularity with
the haunters of coffee-houses. When roistering was
in fashion, a young man had many chances which he
no longer possesses. After the theatres were closed,
he reeled into the hostels of the town, singing snatches
with the blithe, clear voice of youth, laughing and
jesting with all around, and frequently amongst that
"all" he came in contact with the highest and most
powerful men of the time. A boy-adventurer could
display his wit and quality to statesmen and leaders
of all sorts; whereas now he must wait years before
he is even introduced to them, and years more ere he
gets an invitation to their formal dinners, at which
Barnes Newcome cuts as brilliant a figure as the best
and the strongest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>Throughout his life Radcliffe was a staunch and
manly Jacobite. He was for "the king"; but neither
loyalty nor interest could bind him to higher considerations
than those of attachment to the individual
he regarded as the rightful head of the realm. In
1688, when Obadiah Walker tried to wheedle him
into the folly of becoming a Romanist, the attempt
at perversion proved a signal failure. Nothing can
be more truly manly than his manner of rejecting
the wily advances of the proselytizing pervert. "The
advantages you propose to me," he writes, "may be
very great, for all that I know; God Almighty can
do very much and so can the king; but you'll pardon
me if I cease to speak like a physician for once, and,
with an air of gravity, am very apprehensive that I
may anger the one in being too complaisant to the
other. You cannot call this pinning my faith to any
man's sleeve; those that know me are too well apprized
of my quite contrary tendency. As I never
flattered a man myself, so 'tis my firm resolution
never to be wheedled out of my real sentiments—which
are, that since it has been my good fortune
to be educated according to the usage of the Church
of England, established by law, I shall never make
myself so unhappy as to shame my teachers and instructors
by departing from what I have imbibed
from them."</p>

<p>Thus was Walker treated when he abused his position
as head of University College. But when the
foolish man was deprived of his office, he found a
good friend in him whom he had tried to seduce from
the Church in which he had been reared. From the
time of his first coming to London from Oxford, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the abdication of James the Second, up to the time
of his death, Walker subsisted on a handsome allowance
made to him out of Radcliffe's purse. When,
also, the discarded principal died, it was the doctor
who gave him an honourable interment in Pancras
churchyard, and years afterwards erected a monument
to his memory.</p>

<p>As years passed on, without the restitution of the
proscribed males of the Stuart House, Radcliffe's
political feelings became more bitter. He was too
cautious a man to commit himself in any plot having
for its object a change of dynasty; but his ill-humour
at the existing state of things vented itself in continual
sarcasms against the chiefs of the Whig party
with whom he came in contact. He professed that he
did not wish for practice amongst the faction to
which he was opposed. He had rather only preserve
the lives of those citizens who were loyal to their
king. One of the immediate results of this affectation
was increased popularity with his political antagonists.
Whenever a Whig leader was dangerously ill,
his friends were sure to feel that his only chance of
safety rested on the ministrations of the Jacobite
doctor. Radcliffe would be sent for, and after swearing
a score of times that nothing should induce him
to comply with the summons, would make his appearance
at the sick-bed, where he would sometimes tell
the sufferer that the devil would have no mercy on
those who put constitutional governments above the
divine right of kings. If the patient recovered, of
course his cure was attributed to the Tory physician;
and if death was the result, the same cause was
pointed to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>It might be fancied that, rather than incur a charge
of positively killing his political antagonists, Radcliffe
would have left them to their fates. But this
plan would have served him the reverse of well. If
he failed to attend a Whig's death-bed to which he
had been summoned, the death was all the same attributed
to him. "He might," exclaimed the indignant
survivors, "have saved poor Tom if he had
liked; only poor Tom was a Whig, and so he left him
to die." He was charged alike with killing Queen
Mary, whom he did attend in her dying illness—and
Queen Anne, whom he didn't.</p>

<p>The reader of the Harleian MS. of Burnet's "History"
is amused with the following passage, which
does not appear in the printed editions:—"I will
not enter into another province, nor go out of my own
profession, and so will say no more of the physician's
part, but that it was universally condemned; so that
the Queen's death was imputed to the unskilfulness
and wilfulness of Dr. Radcliffe, an impious and
vicious man, who hated the Queen much, but virtue
and religion more. He was a professed Jacobite, and
was, by many, thought a very bad physician; but
others cried him up to the highest degree imaginable.
He was called for, and it appeared but too evident
that his opinion was depended on. Other physicians
were called when it was too late; all symptoms were
bad, yet still the Queen felt herself well."</p>

<p>Radcliffe's negative murder of Queen Anne was
yet more amusing than his positive destruction of
Mary. When Queen Anne was almost <i>in extremis</i>,
Radcliffe was sent for. The Queen, though she
never forgave him for his drunken ridicule of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
vapours, had an exalted opinion of his professional
talents, and had, more than once, winked at her ladies,
consulting him about the health of their royal mistress.
Now that death was at hand, Lady Masham
sent a summons for the doctor; but he was at Carshalton,
sick of his dying illness, and returned answer
that it would be impossible for him to leave his country-seat
and wait on her Majesty. Such was the absurd
and superstitious belief in his mere presence,
that the Queen was popularly pictured as having died
because he was not present to see her draw her last
breath. Whom he liked he could kill, and whom he
liked could keep alive and well. Even Arbuthnot, a
brother physician, was so tinctured with the popular
prejudice, that he could gravely tell Swift of the
pleasure Radcliffe had "in preserving my Lord Chief
Justice Holt's wife, whom he attended out of spite
to her husband, who wished her dead."</p>

<p>It makes one smile to read Charles Ford's letter
to the sarcastic Dean on the subject of the Queen's
last illness. "She continued ill the whole day. In
the evening I spoke to Dr Arbuthnot, and he told me
that he did not think her distemper was desperate.
Radcliffe was sent for to Carshalton about noon, by
order of council; but said he had taken physic and
could not come. <i>In all probability he had saved her
life; for I am told the late Lord Gower had been often
in the condition with the gout in the head, and Radcliffe
kept him alive many years after.</i>" The author
of Gulliver must have grinned as he read this sentence.
It was strange stuff to write about "that
puppy Radcliffe" (as the Dean calls the physician
in his journal to Stella) to the man who coolly sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
out word to a Dublin mob that he had put off an
eclipse to a more suitable time. The absurdity of
Ford's letter is heightened by the fact that it was
written before the Queen's death. It is dated July
31, 1714, and concludes with the following postscript:—"The
Queen is something better, and the
council again adjourned till eight in the morning."
Surely the accusation, then, of negative womanslaughter
was preferred somewhat prematurely. The
next day, however, the Queen died; and then arose a
magnificent hubbub of indignation against the impious
doctor. The poor man himself sinking into
the grave, was at that country-seat where he had entertained
his medical friends with so many noisy
orgies. But the cries for vengeance reached him in
his retreat. "Give us back our ten days!" screamed
the rabble of London round Lord Chesterfield's carriage.
"Give us back our Queen!" was the howl
directed against Radcliffe. The accused was a member
of the House of Commons, having been elected
M.P. for the town of Buckingham in the previous
year; and positively a member (one of Radcliffe's
intimate personal acquaintances) moved that the
physician should be summoned to attend in his place
and be censured for not attending her late Majesty.
To a friend the doctor wrote from Carshalton on
August 7, 1714:—"Dear Sir,—I could not have
thought so old an acquaintance, and so good a friend
as Sir John always professed himself, would have
made such a motion against me. God knows my will
to do her Majesty any service has ever got the start
of my ability, and I have nothing that gives me
greater anxiety and trouble than the death of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
great and glorious Princess. I must do that justice
to the physicians that attended her in her illness,
from a sight of the method that was taken for her
preservation, transmitted to me by Dr Mead, as to
declare nothing was omitted for her preservation;
but the people about her (the plagues of Egypt fall
upon them!) put it out of the power of physick to
be of any benefit to her. I know the nature of attending
crowned heads to their last moments too well to
be fond of waiting upon them, without being sent
for by a proper authority. You have heard of pardons
signed for physicians before a sovereign's demise.
However, as ill as I was, I would have went to
the Queen in a horse-litter, had either her Majesty,
or those in commission next to her, commanded me so
to do. You may tell Sir John as much, and assure
him, from me, that his zeal for her Majesty will not
excuse his ill usage of <i>a friend who has drunk many
a hundred bottles with him</i>, and cannot, even after
this breach of good understanding, that was ever preserved
between us, but have a very good esteem for
him."</p>

<p>So strong was the feeling against the doctor, that
a set of maniacs at large formed a plan for his assassination.
Fortunately, however, the plot was made
known to him in the following letter:—</p>

<p>"Doctor,—Tho' I am no friend of yours, but, on
the contrary, one that could wish your destruction
in a legal way, for not preventing the death of our
most excellent Queen, whom you had it in your
power to save, yet I have such an aversion to the
taking away men's lives unfairly, as to acquaint you
that if you go to meet the gentlemen you have appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to dine with at the 'Greyhound,' in Croydon,
on Thursday next, you will be most certainly murthered.
I am one of the persons engaged in the conspiracy,
with twelve more, who are resolved to sacrifice
you to the <i>Ghost of her late Majesty, that cries
aloud for blood</i>; therefore, neither stir out of doors
that day, nor any other, nor think of exchanging
your present abode for your house at Hammersmith,
since there and everywhere else we shall be in quest
of you. I am touched with remorse, and give you
this notice; but take care of yourself, lest I repent
of it, and give proofs of so doing, by having it in my
power to destroy you, who am your sworn enemy.—N. G."</p>

<p>That thirteen men could have been found to meditate
such a ridiculous atrocity is so incredible, that
one is inclined to suspect a hoax in this epistle.
Radcliffe, however, did not see the letter in that light.
Panic-struck, he kept himself a close prisoner to his
house and its precincts, though he was very desirous
of paying another visit to London—the monotony of
his rural seclusion being broken only by the customary
visits of his professional associates who came
down to comfort and drink with him. The end, however,
was fast approaching. The maladies under
which he suffered were exacerbated by mental disquiet;
and his powers suddenly failing him, he expired
on the 1st of November, 1714, just three months
after the death of the murdered Queen, of whose
vapours he had spoken so disrespectfully.</p>

<p>His original biographer (from whose work all his
many memoirs have been taken) tells the world that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the great physician "<i>fell a victim to the ingratitude
of a thankless world, and the fury of the gout</i>."</p>

<p>Radcliffe was an ignorant man, but shrewd enough
to see that in the then existing state of medical science
the book-learning of the Faculty could be but
of little service to him. He was so notoriously deficient
in the literature of his profession, that his
warmest admirers made merry about it. Garth happily
observed that for Radcliffe to leave a library
was as if a eunuch should found a seraglio. Nor was
Radcliffe ashamed to admit his lack of lore. Indeed,
he was proud of it; and on the inquiry being made
by Bathurst, the head of Trinity College, Oxford,
where his study was, he pointed to a few vials, a skeleton,
and an herbal, and answered, "This is Radcliffe's
library." Mead, who rose into the first favour
of the town as the doctor retired from it, was an
excellent scholar; but far from assuming on that
ground a superiority to his senior, made it the means
of paying him a graceful compliment. The first time
that Radcliffe called on Mead when in town he found
his young friend reading Hippocrates.</p>

<p>"Do you read Hippocrates in Greek?" demanded
the visitor.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mead, timidly fearing his scholarship
would offend the great man.</p>

<p>"I never read him in my life," responded Radcliffe,
sullenly.</p>

<p>"You, sir," was the rejoinder, "have no occasion—you
are Hippocrates himself."</p>

<p>A man who could manufacture flattery so promptly
and courageously deserved to get on. Radcliffe swallowed
the fly, and was glad to be the prey of the expert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
angler. Only the day before, Mead had thrown
in his ground-bait. As a promising young man, Radcliffe
had asked him to a dinner-party at Carshalton,
with the hospitable resolve of reducing such a promising
young man to a state of intoxication, in the
presence of the assembled elders of his profession.
Mead, however, was not to be so managed. He had
strong nerves, and was careful to drink as little as
he could without attracting attention by his abstinence.
The consequence was that Mead saw magnate
after magnate disappear under the table, just as he
had before seen magnum after magnum disappear
above it; and still he retained his self-possession. At
last he and his host were the only occupants of the
banqueting-room left in a non-recumbent position.
Radcliffe was delighted with his youthful acquaintance—loved
him almost as well as he had loved Billy
Nutley.</p>

<p>"Mead," cried the enthusiastic veteran to the young
man, who anyhow had not <i>fallen</i> from his chair, "you
are a <i>rising</i> man. You will succeed me."</p>

<p>"That, sir, is impossible," Mead adroitly answered;
"You are Alexander the Great, and no one can succeed
Radcliffe; to succeed to one of his kingdoms is
the utmost of my ambition."</p>

<p>Charmed with the reply, Radcliffe exclaimed,</p>

<p>"By ——, I'll recommend you to my patients."</p>

<p>The promise was kept; and Mead endeavoured to
repay the worldly advancement with spiritual council.
"I remember," says Kennett (<i>vide</i> Lansdowne
MSS., Brit. Mus.), "what Dr Mede has told to several
of his friends, that he fell much into the favour
of Dr Radcliffe a few years before his death, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
visited him often at Carshalton, where he observed
upon occasion that there was no Bible to be found
in the house. Dr Mede had a mind to supply that
defect, without taking any notice of it; and therefore
one day carried down with him a very beautiful Bible
that he had lately bought, which had lain in a closet
of King William for his Majesty's own use, and left
it as a curiosity that he had picked up by the way.
When Dr Mede made the last visit to him he found
that Dr R. had read in it as far as the middle of the
Book of Exodus, from whence it might be inferred
that he had never before read the Scriptures; as I
doubt must be inferred of Dr Linacre, from the account
given by Sir John Cheke."</p>

<p>The allusion to "the kingdom of Alexander the
Great" reminds one of Arbuthnot's letter to Swift, in
which the writer concludes his sketch of the proposed
map of diseases for Martinus Scriblerus with—"Then
the great diseases are like capital cities, with their
symptoms all like streets and suburbs, with the roads
that lead to other diseases. It is thicker set with
towns than any Flanders map you ever saw. Radcliffe
is painted at the corner of the map, contending
for the universal empire of this world, and the rest
of the physicians opposing his ambitious designs,
with a project of a treaty of partition to settle
peace."</p>

<p>As a practitioner, Radcliffe served the public as
well as he did his own interests. The violent measures
of bleeding, and the exhibition of reducing medicines,
which constituted the popular practice even to
the present generation, he regarded with distrust in
some cases and horror in others. There is a good story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
told of him, that well illustrates his disapproval of
a kill-or-cure system, and his hatred of Nurse Gibbons.
John Bancroft, the eminent surgeon, who resided
in Russell Street, Covent Garden, had a son attacked
with inflammation of the lungs. Gibbons was
called in, and prescribed the most violent remedies,
or rather the most virulent irritants. The child became
rapidly worse, and Radcliffe was sent for. "I
can do nothing, sir," observed the doctor, after visiting
his patient, "for the poor little boy's preservation.
He is killed to all intents and purposes. But if you
have any thoughts of putting a stone over him, I'll
help you to an inscription." The offer was accepted,
and over the child's grave, in Covent Garden churchyard,
was placed a stone sculptured with a figure of
a child laying one hand on his side, and saying, "Hic
dolor," and pointing with the other to a death's head
on which was engraved, "Ibi medicus." This is about
the prettiest professional libel which we can point to
in all the quarrels of the Faculty.</p>

<p>The uses to which the doctor applied his wealth
every one knows. Notwithstanding his occasional acts
of munificence, and a loss of £5000 in an East Indian
venture, into which Betterton, the tragedian, seduced
him, his accumulations were very great. In his will,
after liberally providing for the members of his family
and his dependents, he devoted his acquisitions to the
benefit of the University of Oxford. From them have
proceeded the Radcliffe Library, the Radcliffe Infirmary,
the Radcliffe Observatory, and the Radcliffe
Travelling Fellowships. It is true that nothing has
transpired in the history of these last-mentioned endowments
to justify us in reversing the sentiment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Johnson, who remarked to Boswell: "It is wonderful
how little good Radcliffe's Travelling Fellowships
have done. I know nothing that has been imported by
them."</p>

<p>After lying in state at his own residence, and again
in the University, Radcliffe's body was interred, with
great pomp, in St. Mary's Church, Oxford. The royal
gift of so large an estate (which during life he
had been unable thoroughly to enjoy) to purchase a
library, the contents of which he at no time could
have read, of course provoked much comment. It
need not be said that the testator's memory was, for
the most part, extolled to the skies. He had died rich—a
great virtue in itself. He was dead; and as men
like to deal out censure as long as it can cause pain,
and scatter praise when it can no longer create happiness,
Radcliffe, the physician, the friend of suffering
humanity, the benefactor of ancient and Tory Oxford,
was spoken of in "most handsome terms." One
could hardly believe that this great good man, this
fervent Christian and sublime patriot, was the same
man as he whom Steele had ridiculed for servile vanity,
and to bring whom into contempt a play was written,
and publicly acted, only ten years before, to the
intense delight of the Duchess of Marlborough, and
the applauding maids of honour.</p>

<p>The philosophic Mandeville, far from approving
the behaviour of the fickle multitude, retained his
old opinion of the doctor, and gave it to the world
in his "Essay on Charity and Charity Schools."
"That a man," writes Mandeville, "with small skill in
physic, and hardly any learning, should by vile arts
get into practice, and lay up great wealth, is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
mighty wonder; but that he should so deeply work
himself into the good opinion of the world as to gain
the general esteem of a nation, and establish a reputation
beyond all his contemporaries, with no other
qualities but a perfect knowledge of mankind, and
a capacity of making the most of it, is something extraordinary.</p>

<p>"If a man arrived to such a height of glory should
be almost distracted with pride—sometime give his
attendance on a servant, or any mean person, for nothing
and at the same time neglect a nobleman that
gives exhorbitant fees—at other times refuse to leave
his bottle for his business, without any regard to the
quality of the persons that sent for him, or the danger
they are in; if he should be surly and morose, affect
to be an humourist, treat his patients like dogs,
though people of distinction, and value no man but
what would deify him, and never call in question the
certainty of his oracles; if he should insult all the
world, affront the first nobility, and extend his insolence
even to the royal family; if to maintain, as well
as to increase, the fame of his sufficiency, he should
scorn to consult his betters, on what emergency soever,
look down with contempt on the most deserving
of his profession, and never confer with any other
physician but what will pay homage to his genius,
creep to his humour, and ever approach him with all
the slavish obsequiousness a court flatterer can treat
a prince with; if a man in his life-time should discover,
on the one hand, such manifest symptoms of superlative
pride, and an insatiable greediness after
wealth at the same time; and, on the other, no regard
to religion or affection to his kindred, no compassion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to the poor, and hardly any humanity to his fellow-creatures;
if he gave no proofs that he loved his country,
had a public spirit, or was a lover of the arts, of
books, or of literature—what must we judge of his
motive, the principle he acted from, when, after his
death, we find that he has left a trifle among his relations
who stood in need of it, and an immense treasure
to a University that did not want it.</p>

<p>"Let a man be as charitable as it is possible for
him to be, without forfeiting his reason or good sense,
can he think otherwise, but that this famous physician
did, in the making of his will, as in everything
else, indulge his darling passion, entertaining his
vanity with the happiness of the contrivance?"</p>

<p>This severe portrait is just about as true as the likeness
of a man, painted by a conscientious enemy, usually
is. Radcliffe was not endowed with a kindly
nature. "Mead, I love you," said he to his fascinating
adulator; "and I'll tell you a sure secret to make
your fortune—use all mankind ill." Radcliffe carried
out his rule by wringing as much as possible
from, and returning as little as possible to, his fellowmen.
He could not pay a tradesman's bill without a
sense of keen suffering. Even a poor pavior, who had
been employed to do a job to the stones before the doctor's
house in Bloomsbury Square (whither the physician
removed from Bow Street), could not get his
money without a contest. "Why, you rascal!" cried
the debtor, as he alighted from his chariot, "do you
pretend to be paid for such a piece of work! Why,
you have spoiled my pavement, and then covered it
over with earth to hide the bad work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>"Doctor," responded the man, dryly, "mine is not
the only bad work the earth hides."</p>

<p>Of course, the only course to pursue with a creditor
who could dun in this sarcastic style was to pay, and
be rid of him. But the doctor made up for his own
avarice by being ever ready to condemn it in others.</p>

<p>Tyson, the miser, being near his last hour, magnanimously
resolved to pay two of his 3,000,000 guineas
to Radcliffe, to learn if anything could be done for his
malady. The miserable old man came up with his
wife from Hackney, and tottered into the consulting-room
in Bloomsbury Square, with two guineas in his
hand—</p>

<p>"You may go, sir," exclaimed Radcliffe, to the
astonished wretch, who trusted he was unknown—"you
may go home, and die, and be ——, without a
speedy repentance; for both the grave and the devil
are ready for Tyson of Hackney, who has grown rich
out of the spoils of the public and the tears of orphans
and widows. You'll be a dead man, sir, in ten days."</p>

<p>There are numerous stories extant relative to Radcliffe's
practice; but nearly all those which bear the
stamp of genuineness are unfit for publication in the
present polite age. Such stories as the hasty-pudding
one, re-edited by the pleasant author of "The Gold-headed
Cane," can be found by the dozen, but the
cumbrous workmanship of Mr. Joseph Miller is manifest
in them all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE DOCTOR AS A BON-VIVANT.</h3>


<p>"What must I do, sir!" inquired an indolent bon-vivant
of Abernethy.</p>

<p>"Live on sixpence a day, and earn it, sir," was the
stern answer.</p>

<p>Gabriel Fallopius, who has given his name to a
structure with which anatomists are familiar, gave the
same reproof in a more delicate manner. With a
smile he replied in the words of Terence,</p>

<p>"Otio abundas Antipho,"—"Sir, you're as lazy as
Hall's dog."</p>

<p>But, though medical practitioners have dealt in
sayings like these, to do them bare justice, it must be
admitted that their preaching has generally been contradicted
by the practice. When medicine remained
very much in the hands of the ladies, the composition
of remedies, and the making of dinners, went on in
the same apartment. Indeed hunger and thirst were
but two out of a list of diseases that were ministered
to by the attendants round a kitchen table. The same
book held the receipts for dishes and the recipes for
electuaries. In many an old hall of England the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
manual still remains from which three centuries ago
the lady of the house learned to dress a boar's head or
cure a cold. Most physicians would now disdain to
give dietetic instruction to a patient beyond the most
general directions; but there are cases where, even in
these days, they stoop to do so, with advantage to
themselves and their patients.</p>

<p>"I have ordered twelve dinners this morning," a
cheery little doctor said to the writer of these pages,
on the white cliffs of a well-known sea-side town.</p>

<p>"Indeed—I did not know that was your business."</p>

<p>"But it is. A host of rich old invalids come down
here to be medicinally treated. They can't be happy
without good living, and yet are so ignorant of the science
and art of eating, that they don't know how to
distinguish between a luxurious and pernicious diet,
and a luxurious and wholesome one. They flock to
the 'Duke's Hotel,' and I always tell the landlord
what they are to have. Each dinner costs three or
four guineas. They'd grudge them, and their consciences
would be uneasy at spending so much money,
if they ordered their dinners themselves. But when
they regard the fare as medicine recommended by the
doctor, there is no drawback to their enjoyment of it.
Their confidence in me is unbounded."</p>

<p>The bottle and the board were once the doctor's two
favourite companions. More than one eminent physician
died in testifying his affection for them. In the
days of tippling they were the most persevering of
tavern-haunters. No wonder that some of them were
as fat as Daniel Lambert, and that even more died
sudden deaths from apoplexy. The obesity of Dr.
Stafford was celebrated in an epitaph:—</p>

<div class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Take heed, O good traveller, and do not tread hard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">For here lies Dr. Stafford in all this churchyard."</span>
</div>

<p>Dr. Beddoes was so stout that the Clifton ladies
used to call him their "walking feather-bed."</p>

<p>Dr. Flemyng weighed twenty stone and eleven
pounds, till he reduced his weight by abstinence from
the delicacies of the table, and by taking a quarter of
an ounce of common Castile soap every night.</p>

<p>Dr. Cheyne's weight was thirty-two stone, till he
cured himself by persevering in a temperate diet.
Laughing at two unwieldly noblemen whose corpulence
was the favourite jest of all the wits in the
court, Louis XV. said to one of them, "I suppose you
take little or no exercise."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty will pardon me," replied the bulky
duke, "for I generally walk two or three times round
my cousin every morning."</p>

<p>Sir Theodore Mayerne, who, though he was the
most eminent physician of his time, did not disdain to
write "Excellent and Well-Approved Receipts in
Cookery, with the best way of Preserving," was killed
by tavern wine. He died, after returning from supper
in a Strand hotel; his immediate friends attributing
his unexpected death to the quality of the beverage,
but others, less charitable, setting it down to the
quantity.</p>

<p>Not many years ago, about a score surgeons were
dining together at a tavern, when, about five minutes
after some very "particular port" had been sent round
for the first time, they all fell back in their chairs,
afflicted in various degrees with sickness, vertigo, and
spasm. A more pleasant sight for the waiters can
hardly be conceived. One after one the gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
were conveyed to beds or sofas. Unfortunately for
the startling effect which the story would otherwise
have produced, they none of them expired. The next
day they remembered that, instead of relishing the
"particular port," they had detected a very unpleasant
smack in it. The black bottles were demanded
from the trembling landlord, when chemical analysis
soon discovered that they had been previously used
for fly-poison, and had not been properly cleansed. A
fine old crust of such a kind is little to be desired.</p>

<p>It would perhaps have been well had old Butler
(mentioned elsewhere in these volumes) met with a
similar mishap, if it had only made him a less obstinate
frequenter of beer-shops. He loved tobacco,
deeming it</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i4">"A physician<br></span>
<span class="i0">Good both for sound and sickly;<br></span>
<span class="i1">'Tis a hot perfume<br></span>
<span class="i1">That expels cold Rheume,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And makes it flow down quickly."</span>
</div>

<p>It is on record that he made one of his patients
smoke twenty-five pipes at a sitting. But fond though
he was of tobacco, he was yet fonder of beer. He invented
a drink called "Butler's Ale," afterwards
sold at the Butler's Head, in Mason's Alley, Basinghall
Street. Indeed, he was a sad old scamp. Nightly
he would go to the tavern, and drink deeply for
hours, till his maid-servant, old Nell, came between
nine and ten o'clock and <i>fetched</i> him home, scolding
him all the way for being such a sot. But though
Butler liked ale and wine for himself, he thought
highly of water for other people. When he occupied
rooms in the Savoy, looking over the Thames, a gentleman
afflicted with an ague came to consult him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Butler tipped the wink to his servants, who flung the
sick man, in the twinkling of an eye, slap out of the
window into the river. We are asked to believe that
"the surprise absolutely cured" the patient of his
malady.</p>

<p>The physicians of Charles the Second's day were
jolly fellows. They made deep drinking and intrigue
part of their profession as well as of their practice.
Their books contain arguments in favour of indulgence,
which their passions suggested and the taste of
the times approved. Tobias Whitaker and John
Archer, both physicians in ordinary to the merry
monarch, were representative men of their class.
Whitaker, a Norfolk man, practised with success at
Norwich before coming up to London. He published
a discourse upon waters, that proved him very ignorant
on the subject; and a treatise on the properties of
wine, that is a much better testimony to the soundness
of his understanding. Prefixed to his "Elenchus of
opinions on Small-Pox," is a portrait that represents
him as a well-looking fellow. That he was a sincere
and discerning worshipper of Bacchus, is shown by
his "Tree of Humane Life, or the Bloud of the Grape.
Proving the possibilitie of maintaining humane life
from infancy to extreame old age without any sicknesse
by the use of Wine." In this work (sold, by the
way, in the author's shop, Pope's Head Alley) we
read of wine,—"This is the phisick that doth not dull,
but sets a true edge upon nature, after operation
leaveth no venomous contact. Sure I am this was
ancient phisick, else what meant Avicenna, Rhasis,
and Averroes, to move the body twice every month
with the same; as it is familiar to Nature, so they used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
it familiarly. As for my own experience, though I
have not lived yet so long as to love excesse, yet have
I seene such powerful effects, both on my selfe and
others, as if I could render no other reason, they were
enough to persuade me of its excellencie, seeing extenuate
withered bodies by it caused to be faire, fresh,
plumpe, and fat, old and infirme to be young and
sound, when as water or small-beer drinkers looke like
apes rather than men."</p>

<p>John Archer, the author of "Every Man his own
Doctor," and "Secrets Disclosed," was an advocate
of generous diet and enlightened sensuality. His
place of business was "a chamber in a Sadler's howse
over against the Black Horse nigh Charing-cross,"
where his hours of attendance for some years were
from 11 <small>A. M.</small> to 5 <small>P. M.</small> each day. On setting up a
house at Knightsbridge, where he resided in great
style, he shortened the number of hours daily passed
in London. In 1684 he announced in one of his works—"For
these and other Directions you may send to
the Author, at his chamber against the <i>Mews</i> by Charing-cross,
who is certainly there from twelve to four,
at other times at his house at Knightsbridge, being a
mile from Charing-cross, where is good air for cure of
consumptions, melancholy, and other infirmities."
He had also a business established in Winchester
Street, near Gresham College, next door to the <i>Fleece
Tavern</i>. Indeed, physician-in-ordinary to the King
though he was, he did not think it beneath him to
keep a number of apothecaries' shops, and, like Whitaker,
to live by the sale of drugs as well as fees. His
cordial dyet drink was advertised as costing 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per quart; for a box containing 30 morbus pills, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
charge was 5<i>s.</i>; 40 corroborating pills were to be had
for the same sum. Like Dr. Everard, he recommended
his patients to smoke, saying that "tobacco
smoke purified the air from infectious malignancy by
its fragrancy, sweetened the breath, strengthened the
brain and memory, and revived the sight to admiration."
He sold tobacco, of a superior quality to the
ordinary article of commerce, at 2<i>s.</i> and 1<i>s.</i> an ounce.
"The order of taking it is like other tobacco at any
time; its virtues may be perceived by taking one pipe,
after which you will spit more, and your mouth will
be dryer than after common tobacco, which you may
moisten by drinking any warm drink, as coffee, &amp;c.,
or with sugar candy, liquorish, or a raisin, and you
will find yourself much refreshed."</p>

<p>Whilst Whitaker and Archer were advising men to
smoke and drink, another physician of the Court was
inventing a stomach-brush, in some respects much like
the bottle-brush with which fly-poison ought to be
taken from the interior of black bottles before wine is
committed to them. This instrument was pushed
down the gullet, and then poked about and turned
round, much in the same way as a chimney-sweeper's
brush is handled by a dexterous operator on soot. It
was recommended that gentlemen should thus sweep
out their insides not oftener than once a week, but not
less frequently than once a month. The curious may
find not only a detailed description but engraved likeness
of this remarkable stomach-brush in the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i>, vol. xx., for the year 1750.</p>

<p>It would be unfair to take leave of Dr. Archer without
mentioning his three inventions, on which he
justly prided himself not a little. He constructed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
hot steam-bath, an oven "which doth with a small
faggot bake a good quantity of anything," and "a
compleat charriot that shall with any ordinary horse
run swift with four or five people within, and there
is place for more without, all which one horse can as
easily draw as two horses." In these days of vapour
baths, bachelors' kettles, and broughams, surely Dr.
Archer ought to have a statue by the side of Jenner
in Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p>The doctors of Anne's time were of even looser
morals than their immediate predecessors. In taverns,
over wine, they received patients and apothecaries.
It became fashionable (a fashion that has lasted
down to the present day) for a physician to scratch
down his prescriptions illegibly; the mode, in all
probability, arising from the fact that a doctor's hand
was usually too unsteady to write distinctly.</p>

<p>Freind continually visited his patients in a state of
intoxication. To one lady of high rank he came in
such a state of confusion that when in her room he
could only grumble to himself, "Drunk—drunk—drunk,
by God!" Fortunately the fair patient was
suffering from the same malady as her doctor, who (as
she learnt from her maid on returning to consciousness)
had made the above bluff comment on <i>her</i> case,
and then had gone away. The next day, Freind was
sitting in a penitent state over his tea, debating what
apology he should offer to his aristocratic patient,
when he was relieved from his perplexity by the arrival
of a note from the lady herself enclosing a handsome
fee, imploring her dear Dr. Freind to keep her
secret, and begging him to visit her during the course
of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>On another occasion Freind wrote a prescription
for a member of an important family, when his faculties
were so evidently beyond his control that Mead
was sent for. On arriving, Mead, with a characteristic
delicacy towards his professional friend, took up
the tipsy man's prescription, and having looked at it,
said, "'Pon my honour, Dr. Freind can write a better
prescription when drunk than I can when sober."</p>

<p>Gibbons—the "Nurse Gibbons" of our old friend
Radcliffe—was a deep drinker, disgusting, by the
grossness of his debaucheries, the polite and epicurean
Garth. But Gibbons did something for English
dinner-tables worth remembering. He brought into
domestic use the mahogany with which we have so
many pleasant associations. His brother, a West Indian
Captain, brought over some of the wood as ballast,
thinking it might possibly turn to use. At first
the carpenters, in a truly conservative spirit, refused
to have anything to do with the "new wood," saying
it was too hard for their tools. Dr. Gibbons, however,
had first a candle-box and then a bureau made for
Mrs. Gibbons out of the condemned material. The
bureau so pleased his friends, amongst whom was the
Duchess of Buckingham, that her Grace ordered a
similar piece of furniture, and introduced the wood
into high life, where it quickly became the fashion.</p>

<p>Of Radcliffe's drunkenness mention is made elsewhere.
As an eater, he was a <i>gourmand</i>, not a <i>gourmet</i>.
When Prince Eugene of Savoy came over to
England on a diplomatic mission, his nephew, the
Chevalier de Soissons, fell into the fashion of the
town, roaming it at night in search of frays—a roaring,
swaggering mohock. The sprightly Chevalier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
took it into his head that it would be a pleasant thing
to thrash a watchman; so he squared up to one, and
threatened to kill him. Instead of succumbing, the
watchman returned his assailant's blows, and gave
him an awful thrashing. The next day, what with the
mauling he had undergone, and what with <i>delirium
tremens</i>, the merry roisterer was declared by his physician,
Sieur Swartenburgh, to be in a dying state.
Radcliffe was called in, and acting on his almost invariable
rule, told Prince Eugene that the young man
must die, <i>because</i> Swartenburgh had maltreated him.
The prophecy was true, if the criticism was not. The
Chevalier died, and was buried amongst the Ormond
family in Westminster Abbey—it being given out to
the public that he had died of small-pox.</p>

<p>Prince Eugene conceived a strong liking for Radcliffe,
and dined with him at the Doctor's residence.
The dinner Radcliffe put before his guest is expressive
of the coarseness both of the times and the man.
On the table the only viands were barons of beef, jiggets
of mutton, legs of pork, and such other ponderous
masses of butcher's stuff, which no one can look
at without discomfort, when the first edge has been
taken off the appetite. Prince Eugene expressed himself
delighted with "the food and liquors!"</p>

<p>George Fordyce, like Radcliffe, was fond of substantial
fare. For more than twenty years he dined
daily at Dolly's Chop-house. The dinner he there
consumed was his only meal during the four-and-twenty
hours, but its bulk would have kept a boa-constrictor
happy for a twelvemonth. Four o'clock was
the hour at which the repast commenced, when, punctual
to a minute, the Doctor seated himself at a table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
specially reserved for him, and adorned with a silver
tankard of strong ale, a bottle of port-wine, and a
measure containing a quarter of a pint of brandy.
Before the dinner was first put on, he had one light
dish of a broiled fowl, or a few whitings. Having
leisurely devoured this plate, the doctor took one glass
of brandy, and asked for his steak. The steak was
always a prime one, weighing one pound and a half.
When the man of science had eaten the whole of it, he
took the rest of his brandy, then drank his tankard of
heady ale, and, lastly, sipped down his bottle of port.
Having brought his intellects, up or down, to the
standard of his pupils, he rose and walked down to
his house in Essex Street to give his six o'clock lecture
on Chemistry.</p>

<p>Dr. Beauford was another of the eighteenth-century
physicians who thought temperance a vice that hadn't
even the recommendation of transient pleasure. A
Jacobite of the most enthusiastic sort, he was not less
than Freind a favourite with the aristocracy who
countenanced the Stuart faction. As he was known to
be very intimate with Lord Barrymore, the Doctor
was summoned, in 1745, to appear before the Privy-Council,
and answer the questions of the custodians of
his Majesty's safety and honour.</p>

<p>"You know Lord Barrymore?" said one of the
Lords of Council.</p>

<p>"Intimately—most intimately,"—was the answer.</p>

<p>"You are continually with him?"</p>

<p>"We dine together almost daily when his Lordship
is in town."</p>

<p>"What do you talk about?"</p>

<p>"Eating and drinking."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>"And what else?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my lord, we never talk of anything except eating
and drinking—drinking and eating."</p>

<p>A good deal of treasonable sentiment might have
been exchanged in these discussions of eating and
drinking. "God send this <i>crum-well down</i>!" was the
ordinary toast of the Cavalier during the glorious
Protectorate of Oliver. And long afterwards, English
gentlemen of Jacobite sympathies, drinking "to the
King," before they raised the glass to their lips, put it
over the water-bottle, to indicate where the King was
whose prosperity they pledged.</p>

<p>At the tavern in Finch Lane, where Beauford received
the apothecaries who followed him, he drank
freely, but never was known to give a glass from his
bottle to one of his clients. In this respect he resembled
Dr. Gaskin of Plymouth, a physician in fine practice
in Devonshire at the close of the last century, who
once said to a young beginner in his profession,
"Young man, when you get a fee, don't give fifteen
shillings of it back to your patient in beef and port-wine."</p>

<p>Contemporary with Beauford was Dr. Barrowby—wit,
scholar, political partisan, and toper. Barrowby
was the hero of an oft-told tale, recently attributed in
the newspapers to Abernethy. When canvassing for
a place on the staff of St. Bartholomew's Hospital,
Barrowby entered the shop of one of the governors, a
grocer on Snow-hill, to solicit his influence and vote.
The tradesman, bursting with importance, and anticipating
the pleasure of getting a very low bow from a
gentleman, strutted up the shop, and, with a mixture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of insolent patronage and insulting familiarity, cried,
"Well, friend, and what is your business?"</p>

<p>Barrowby paused for a minute, cut him right
through with the glance of his eye, and then said,
quietly and slowly, "I want a pound of plums."</p>

<p>Confused and blushing, the grocer did up the
plums. Barrowby put them in his pocket, and went
away without asking the fellow for his vote.</p>

<p>A good political story is told of Barrowby, the incident
of which occurred in 1749, eleven years after
his translation of Astruc's "Treatise" appeared.
Lord Trentham (afterwards Lord Gower) and Sir
George Vandeput were contesting the election for
Westminster. Barrowby, a vehement supporter of
the latter, was then in attendance on the notorious Joe
Weatherby, master of the "Ben Jonson's Head," in
Russell Street, who lay in a perilous state, emaciated
by nervous fever. Mrs. Weatherby was deeply afflicted
at her husband's condition, because it rendered
him unable to vote for Lord Trentham. Towards the
close of the polling days the Doctor, calling one day
on his patient, to his great astonishment found him
up, and almost dressed by the nurse and her assistants.</p>

<p>"Hey-day! what's the cause of this?" exclaims
Barrowby. "Why are you up without my leave?"</p>

<p>"Dear Doctor," says Joe, in a broken voice, "I am
going to poll."</p>

<p>"To poll!" roars Barrowby, supposing the man to
hold his wife's political opinions, "you mean going to
the devil! Get to bed, man, the cold air will kill you.
If you don't get into bed instantly you'll be dead
before the day is out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>"I'll do as you bid me, doctor," was the reluctant
answer. "But as my wife was away for the morning,
I thought I could get as far as Covent Garden
Church, and vote for Sir George Vandeput."</p>

<p>"How, Joe, for Sir George?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir, I don't go with my wife. I am a Sir
George's man."</p>

<p>Barrowby was struck by a sudden change for the
better in the man's appearance, and said, "Wait a
minute, nurse. Don't pull off his stockings. Let me
feel his pulse. Humph—a good firm stroke! You
took the pills I ordered you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but they made me feel very ill."</p>

<p>"Ay, so much the better; that's what I wished.
Nurse, how did he sleep?"</p>

<p>"Charmingly, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, Joe," said Barrowby, after a few seconds'
consideration, "if you are bent on going to this election,
your mind ought to be set at rest. It's a fine
sunny day, and a ride will very likely do you good.
So, bedad, I'll take you with me in my chariot."</p>

<p>Delighted with his doctor's urbanity, Weatherby
was taken off in the carriage to Covent Garden, recorded
his vote for Sir George Vandeput, was brought
back in the same vehicle, and died <i>two</i> hours afterwards,
amidst the reproaches of his wife and her
friends of the Court party.</p>

<p>Charles the Second was so impressed with the power
of the Medical Faculty in influencing the various intrigues
of political parties, that he averred that Dr.
Lower, Nell Gwynn's physician, did more mischief
than a troop of horse. But Barrowby was prevented,
by the intrusion of death, from rendering effectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
service to his party. Called away from a dinner-table,
where he was drinking deeply and laughing much, to
see a patient, he got into his carriage, and was driven
off. When the footman opened the door, on arriving
at the house of sickness, he found his master dead. A
fit of apoplexy had struck him down, whilst he was
still a young man, and just as he was ascending to the
highest rank of his profession.</p>

<p>John Sheldon was somewhat addicted to the pleasures
of the table. On one occasion, however, he had
to make a journey fasting. The son of a John Sheldon,
an apothecary who carried on business in the
Tottenham Court Road, a few doors from the Black
Horse Yard, Sheldon conceived in early life a strong
love for mechanics. At Harrow he was birched for
making a boat and floating it. In after life he had a
notable scheme for taking whales with poisoned harpoons;
and, to test its merit, actually made a voyage
to Greenland. He was moreover the first Englishman
to make an ascent in a balloon. He went with
Blanchard, and had taken his place in the car, when
the aeronaut, seeing that his machine was too heavily
weighted, begged him to get out.</p>

<p>"If you are my friend, you will alight. My fame,
my all, depends on success," exclaimed Blanchard.</p>

<p>"I won't," bluntly answered Sheldon, as the balloon
manifested symptoms of rising.</p>

<p>In a furious passion, the little air-traveller exclaimed,
"Then I starve you! Point du chicken, by
Gar, you shall have no chicken." So saying, he flung
the hamper of provisions out of the car, and, thus
lightened, the balloon went up.</p>

<p>Abernethy is said to have reproved an over-fed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
alderman for his excesses at table in the following
manner. The civic footman was ordered to put a
large bowl under the sideboard, and of whatever he
served his master with to throw the same quantity into
the bowl as he put on the gourmand's plate. After
the repast was at an end, the sated feaster was requested
to look into the bowl at a nauseous mess of
mock turtle, turbot, roast-beef, turkey, sausages,
cakes, wines, ale, fruits, cheese.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Jebb showed little favour to the digestion
thinking it was made to be used—not nursed.
Habitually more rough and harsh than Abernethy in
his most surly moods, Jebb offended many of his
patients. "That's <i>my</i> way," said he to a noble invalid,
astonished at his rudeness. "Then," answered
the sick man, pointing to the door, "I beg you'll make
that your way."</p>

<p>To all questions about diet Jebb would respond
tetchily or carelessly.</p>

<p>"Pray, Sir Richard, may I eat a muffin?" asked a
lady.</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, 'tis the <i>best</i> thing you can take."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! Sir Richard, I am glad of that. The
other day you said it was the worst thing in the world
for me."</p>

<p>"Good, madam, I said so last Tuesday. This isn't a
Tuesday—is it?"</p>

<p>To another lady who asked what she might eat he
said contemptuously, "Boiled turnips."</p>

<p>"Boiled turnips!" was the answer; "you forget,
Sir Richard—I told you I could not bear boiled turnips."</p>

<p>"Then, madam," answered Sir Richard, sternly, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
if his sense of the moral fitness of things was
offended, "you must have a d——d vitiated appetite."</p>

<p>Sir Richard's best set of dietetic directions consisted
of the following negative advice, given to an
old gentleman who put the everlasting question,
"What may I eat?" "My directions, sir, are simple.
You must not eat the poker, shovel, or tongs, for they
are hard of digestion; nor the bellows; but anything
else you please."</p>

<p>Even to the King, Sir Richard was plain-spoken.
George the Third lamented to him the restless spirit
of his cousin, Dr. John Jebb, the dissenting minister.
"And please your Majesty," was the answer, "if my
cousin were in heaven he would be a reformer."</p>

<p>Dr. Babington used to tell a story of an Irish gentleman,
for whom he prescribed an emetic, saying, "My
dear doctor, it is of no use your giving me an emetic.
I tried it twice in Dublin, and it would not stay on
my stomach either time." Jebb's stomach would have
gone on tranquilly, even when entertaining an emetic.</p>

<p>Jebb, with all his bluntness, was a mean lover of the
atmosphere of the Court. His income was subject to
great fluctuations, as the whims of his fashionable employers
ran for or against him. Sir Edward Wilmont's
receipts sank from £3000 to £300, in consequence
of his having lost two ladies of quality at the
Court. Jebb's revenue never varied so much as this,
but the £15,000 (the greatest sum he ever made in one
year) often fell off by thousands. This fact didn't
tend to lessen his mortification at the loss of a great
patient. When George the Third dismissed him, and
took Sir George Baker in his place, he nearly died of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
chagrin. And when he was recalled to attend the
royal family in the measles, he nearly died of delight.
This ruling passion exhibited itself strongly in death.
When he was on his death-bed, the Queen, by the hand
of a German lady, wrote to inquire after his condition.
So elated was the poor man with this act of
royal benignity, that he grasped the letter, and never
let go his hold of it till the breath of life quitted his
attenuated body.</p>

<p>This chapter has been for the most part on the
feasting of physicians. We'll conclude it with a few
words on their fasts. In the house of a Strand grocer
there used to be a scientific club, of which the principal
members were—W. Heberden, M.D., J. Turton,
M.D., G. Baker, M.D., Sir John Pringle, Sir William
Watson, and Lord C. Cavendish who officiated as
president. Each member paid sixpence per evening
for the use of the grocer's dining-room. The club
took in one newspaper, and the only refreshment allowed
to be taken at the place of meeting was—water.</p>

<p>The most abstemious of eminent physicians was Sir
Hans Sloane, the president of the Royal Society and
of the College of Physicians, and (in a certain sense)
the founder of the British Museum. A love of money
made him a hater of all good things, except money
and his museum. He gave up his winter soirées in
Bloomsbury Square, in order to save his tea and bread
and butter. At one of these scientific entertainments
Handel offended the scientific knight deeply by laying
a muffin on one of his books. "To be sure it was
a gareless trick," said the composer, when telling the
story, "bud it tid no monsdrous mischief; pode it but
the old poog-vorm treadfully oud of sorts. I offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
my best apologies, but the old miser would not have
done with it. If it had been a biscuit, it would not
have mattered; but muffin and pudder. And I said,
<i>Ah, mine Gotd, that is the rub!—it is the pudder!</i>
Now, mine worthy friend, Sir Hans Sloane, you have
a nodable excuse, you may save your doast and pudder,
and lay it to that unfeeling gormandizing German;
and den I knows it will add something to your
life by sparing your <i>burse</i>."</p>

<p>The eccentric Dr. Glyn of Cambridge, rarely dined,
but used to satisfy his hunger at chance times by cutting
slices off a cold joint (a constant ornament of the
side-table in his study), and eating them while standing.
To eat such a dinner in such an attitude would
be to fare little better than the ascetic physician who
used twice a week to dine off two Abernethy biscuits,
consumed as he walked at the pace of four miles an
hour. However wholesome they may be, the hard
biscuits, known as Abernethies (but in the construction
of which, by-the-by, Abernethy was no more concerned
than were Wellington and Blucher in making
the boots that bear their names), are not convivial
cates, though one would rather have to consume them
than the calomel sandwiches which Dr. Curry (popularly
called Dr. Calomel Curry) used to give his
patients.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>FEES.</h3>


<p>From the earliest times the Leech (Leighis), or
healer, has found, in the exercise of his art, not only a
pleasant sense of being a public benefactor, but also
the means of private advancement. The use the
churchmen made of their medical position throughout
Christendom (both before and after that decree of the
council of Tours, <small>A.D.</small> 1163, which forbade priests and
deacons to perform surgical operations in which cauteries
and incisions were employed), is attested by the
broad acres they extracted, for their religious corporations,
as much from the gratitude as from the superstition
of their patients. And since the Reformation,
from which period the vocations of the spiritual and
the bodily physician have been almost entirely kept
apart, the practitioners of medicine have had cause to
bless the powers of sickness. A good story is told of
Arbuthnot. When he was a young man (ere he had
won the patronage of Queen Anne, and the friendship
of Swift and Pope), he settled at Dorchester, and endeavoured
to get practice in that salubrious town.
Nature obviated his good intentions: he wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
minister to the afflicted, if they were rich enough to
pay for his ministrations, but the place was so healthy
that it contained scarce half-a-dozen sick inhabitants.
Arbuthnot determined to quit a field so ill-adapted for
a display of his philanthropy. "Where are you off
to?" cried a friend, who met him riding post towards
London. "To leave your confounded place," was the
answer, "for a man can neither live nor die there."
But to arrive at wealth was not amongst Arbuthnot's
faculties; he was unable to use his profession as a
trade; and only a few weeks before his death he
wrote, "I am as well as a man can be who is gasping
for breath, and has a house full of men and women
unprovided for."</p>

<p>Arbuthnot's ill-luck, however, was quite out of the
ordinary rule. Fuller says (1662), "Physic hath
promoted many more, and that since the reign of
King Henry VIII. Indeed, before his time, I find a
doctor of physic, father to Reginald, first and last
Lord Bray. But this faculty hath flourished much
the three last fifty years; it being true of physic,
what is said of Sylla, 'suos divitiis explevit.' Sir
William Butts, physician to King Henry VIII., Doctor
Thomas Wendy, and Doctor Hatcher, Queen Elizabeth's
physician, raised worshipful families in Norfolk,
Cambridge, and Lincolnshire, having borne the
office of Sheriff in this county." Sir William Butts
was rewarded for his professional services by Henry
VIII. with the honour of Knighthood, and he attended
that sovereign when the royal confirmation
was given, in 1512, to the charter of the barber-surgeons
of London. Another eminent physician of the
same period, who also arrived at the dignity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
knighthood, was John Ayliffe, a sheriff of London,
and merchant of Blackwell-Hall. His epitaph
records:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>This mode of rewarding medical services was not
unfrequent in those days, and long before. Ignorance
as to the true position of the barber in the middle
ages has induced the popular and erroneous belief
that the barber-surgeon had in olden times a contemptible
social status. Unquestionably his art has
been elevated during late generations to a dignity it
did not possess in feudal life; but it might be argued
with much force, that the reverse has been the case
with regard to his rank. Surgery and medicine were
arts that nobles were proud to practise for honour,
and not unfrequently for emolument. The reigns of
Elizabeth and her three predecessors in sovereign
power abounded in medical and surgical amateurs.
Amongst the fashionable empirics Bulleyn mentions
Sir Thomas Elliot, Sir Philip Paris, Sir William Gasgoyne,
Lady Taylor and Lady Darrel, and especially
that "goodly hurtlesse Gentleman, Sir Andrew Haveningham,
who learned water to kill a canker of his
own mother." Even an Earl of Derby, about this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
time, was celebrated for his skill in <i>chirurgerie</i> and
<i>bone-setting</i>, as also was the Earl of Herfurth. The
Scots nobility were enthusiastic dabblers in such matters;
and we have the evidence of Buchanan and
Lindsay as to James IV. of Scotland, "quod vulnera
scientissime tractaret," to use the former authority's
words, and in the language of the latter, that he was
"such a <i>cunning chirurgeon</i>, that none in his realm
who used that craft but would take his counsel in all
their proceedings." The only art which fashionable
people now-a-days care much to meddle with is literature.
In estimating the difference between the position
of an eminent surgeon now, and that which he
would have occupied in earlier times, we must remember
that life and hereditary knighthood are the highest
dignities to which he is now permitted to aspire;
although since this honour was first accorded to him
it has so fallen in public estimation, that it has almost
ceased to be an honour at all. It can scarcely be questioned
that if Sir Benjamin Brodie were to be elevated
to the rank of a Baron of the realm, he would
still not occupy a better position, in regard to the
rest of society, than that which Sir William Butts
and Sir John Ayliffe did after they were knighted.
A fact that definitely fixes the high esteem in which
Edward III. held his medical officers, is one of his
grants—"Quod Willielmus Holme Sirurgicus Regis
pro vitâ suâ possit, fugare, capere, et asportare omnimodas
feras in quibuscunque forestis, chaccis parcis
et warrennis regis." Indeed, at a time when the
highest dignitaries of the Church, the proudest bishops
and the wealthiest abbots, practised as physicians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
it followed, as a matter of course, that everything
pertaining to their profession was respected.</p>

<p>From remote antiquity the fee of the healer has
been regarded as a voluntary offering for services
gratuitously rendered. The pretender to the art always
stuck out for a price, and in some form or other
made the demand which was imprinted on the pillboxes
of Lilly's successor, John Case,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Here's fourteen pills for thirteen pence,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Enough in any man's own con-sci-ence."</span>
</div>

<p>But the true physician always left his reward to
be measured by the gratitude and justice of the benefited.
He extorted nothing, but freely received that
which was freely given. Dr. Doran, with his characteristic
erudition, says, "Now there is a religious reason
why fees are supposed not to be taken by physicians.
Amongst the Christian martyrs are reckoned
the two eastern brothers, Damian and Cosmas. They
practised as physicians in Cilicia, and they were the
first mortal practitioners who refused to take recompense
for their work. Hence they were called
Anargyri, or 'without money.' All physicians are
pleasantly supposed to follow this example. They
never take fees, like Damian and Cosmas; but they
meekly receive what they know will be given out of
Christian humility, and with a certain or uncertain
reluctance, which is the nearest approach that can
be made in these times to the two brothers who were
in partnership at Egea in Cilicia."</p>

<p>But, with all due respect to our learned writer,
there is a much better reason for the phenomenon.
Self-interest, and not a Christian ambition to resemble
the charitable Cilician brothers, was the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
physicians preferring a system of gratuities to a system
of legal rights. They could scarcely have put
in <i>a claim</i> without defining the <i>amount claimed</i>; and
they soon discovered that a rich patient, left to his
generosity, folly, and impotent anxiety to propitiate
the mysterious functionary who presided over his
life, would, in a great majority of cases, give ten, or
even a hundred times as much as they in the wildest
audacity of avarice would ever dare to ask for.</p>

<p>Seleucus, for having his son Antiochus restored to
health, was fool enough to give sixty thousand crowns
to Erasistratus: and for their attendance on the Emperor
Augustus, and his two next successors, no less
than four physicians received annual pensions of two
hundred and fifty thousand sesterces apiece. Indeed,
there is no saying what a sick man will not give his
doctor. The "cacoethes donandi" is a manifestation
of enfeebled powers which a high-minded physician
is often called upon to resist, and an unprincipled one
often basely turns to his advantage. Alluding to this
feature of the sick, a deservedly successful and honourable
practitioner, using the language of one of
our Oriental pro-consuls, said with a laugh to the
writer of these pages, "I wonder at my moderation."</p>

<p>But directly health approaches, this desirable
frame of mind disappears. When the devil was sick
he was a very different character from what he was
on getting well. 'Tis so with ordinary patients, not
less than satanic ones. The man who, when he is in
his agonies, gives his medical attendant double fees
three times a day (and vows, please God he recover,
to make his fortune by trumpeting his praises to the
world), on becoming convalescent, grows irritable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
suspicious, and distant,—and by the time he can resume
his customary occupations, looks on his dear
benefactor and saviour as a designing rascal, bent on
plundering him of his worldly possessions. Euricus
Cordus, who died in 1535, seems to have taken the
worst possible time for getting his payment; but it
cannot be regretted that he did so, as his experiences
inspired him to write the following excellent epigram:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tres medicus facies habet; unam quando rogatur,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Angelicam; mox est, cum juvat, ipse Deus.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Post ubi curato, poscit sua prœmia, morbo,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Horridus apparet, terribilisque Sathan."<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Three faces wears the doctor: when first sought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">An angel's—and a God's the cure half wrought:<br></span>
<span class="i0">But when, that cure complete, he seeks his fee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The Devil looks then less terrible than he."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Illustrative of the same truth is a story told of
Bouvart. On entering one morning the chamber of
a French Marquis, whom he had attended through a
very dangerous illness, he was accosted by his noble
patient in the following terms:—</p>

<p>"Good day to you, Mr. Bouvart; I feel quite in
spirits, and think my fever has left me."</p>

<p>"I am sure it has," replied Bouvart, dryly. "The
very first expression you used convinced me of it."</p>

<p>"Pray, explain yourself."</p>

<p>"Nothing is easier. In the first days of your illness,
when your life was in danger, I was your <i>dearest
friend</i>; as you began to get better, I was your
<i>good Bouvart</i>; and now I am Mr. Bouvart: depend
upon it you are quite recovered."</p>

<p>In fact, the affection of a patient for his physician
is very like the love a candidate for a borough has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
for an individual elector—he is very grateful to him,
till he has got all he wants out of him. The medical
practitioner is unwise not to recognize this fact.
Common prudence enjoins him to act as much as possible
on the maxim of "accipe dum dolet"—"take
your fee while your patient is in pain."</p>

<p>But though physicians have always held themselves
open to take as much as they can get, their ordinary
remuneration has been fixed in divers times by custom,
according to the locality of their practice, the
rank of their patients, the nature of the particular
services rendered, and such other circumstances. In
China the rule is "no cure, no pay," save at the Imperial
court, where the physicians have salaries that
are cut off during the continuance of royal indisposition.
For their sakes it is to be hoped that the Emperor
is a temperate man, and does not follow the
example of George the Fourth, who used to drink
Maraschino between midnight and four o'clock in
the morning; and then, when he awoke with a furred
tongue, from disturbed sleep, used to put himself
under the hands of his doctors. Formerly the medical
officers of the English monarch were paid by
salary, though doubtless they were offered, and were
not too proud to accept, fees as well. Coursus de
Gungeland, Edward the Third's apothecary, had a
pension of sixpence a-day—a considerable sum at
that time; and Ricardus Wye, the surgeon of the same
king, had twelve-pence a day, and eight marks per
annum. "Duodecim denarios per diem, et octo marcas
per annum, pro vadiis suis pro vitâ." In the
royal courts of Wales, also, the fees of surgeons and
physicians were fixed by law—a surgeon receiving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
as payment for curing a slight wound, only the blood-stained
garments of the injured person; but for healing
a dangerous wound he had the bloody apparel,
his board and lodging during the time his services
were required, and one hundred and eighty pence.</p>

<p>At a very early period in England a doctor looked
for his palm to be crossed with gold, if his patient
happened to be a man of condition. In Henry
VIII.'s reign a Cambridge physician was presented
by the Earl of Cumberland with a fee of £1—but this
was at least double what a commoner would then have
paid. Stow complains that while in Holland half-a-crown
was looked upon as a proper remuneration for
a single visit paid by a skilled physician, the medical
practitioners of London scorned "to touch any metal
but gold."</p>

<p>It is no matter of uncertainty what the physician's
ordinary fee was at the close of the sixteenth and
the commencement of the seventeenth century. It
was ten shillings, as is certified by the following extract
from "Physick lies a-bleeding: the Apothecary
turned Doctor"—published in 1697:—</p>

<p>"<i>Gallipot</i>—Good sir, be not so unreasonably passionate
and I'll tell you. Sir, the Pearl Julep will
be 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, Pearls being dear since our clipt money
was bought. The Specific Bolus, 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, I never
reckon less; my master in Leadenhall Street never
set down less, be it what it would. The Antihysterick
Application 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> (a common one is but 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>),
and the Anodyne Draught 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>—that's all, sir; a
small matter and please you, sir, for your lady. My
fee is what you please, sir. All the bill is <i>but</i> 18<i>s.</i></p>

<p>"<i>Trueman</i>—Faith, then, d'ye make a <i>but</i> at it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
I do suppose, to be very genteel, I must give you a
crown.</p>

<p>"<i>Gallipot</i>—If your worship please; I take it to be
a fair and an honest bill.</p>

<p>"<i>Trueman</i>—Do you indeed? But I wish you had
called a doctor, perhaps he would have advised her to
have forebore taking anything, as yet at least, so I
had saved 13<i>s.</i> in my pocket."</p>

<p>"Physick lies a-bleeding" was written during the
great Dispensarian War, which is touched upon in
another part of these pages; and its object was to
hold up physicians as models of learning and probity,
and to expose the extortionate practices of the apothecaries.
It must therefore be read with caution, and
with due allowance for the license of satire, and the
violence of a party statement. But the statement
that 10<i>s.</i> was the <i>customary</i> fee is clearly one that
may be accepted as truthful. Indeed, the unknown
and needy doctors were glad to accept less. The
author of "The Dispensarians are the Patriots of
Britain," published in 1708, represents the humbler
physicians being nothing better than the slaves of
the opulent apothecaries, accepting half their right
fee, and taking instead 25 or 50 per cent. of the
amount paid for drugs to the apothecary. "They
(the powerful traders)," says the writer, "offered
the Physicians 5<i>s.</i> and 10<i>s.</i> in the pound, to excite
their industry to prescribe the larger abundance to
all the disorders."</p>

<p>But physicians daily received more than their ten
shillings at a time. In confirmation of this, a good
anecdote may be related of Sir Theodore Mayerne.
Sir Theodore Mayerne, a native of Geneva, was physician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to Henry IV. and Louis XIII. of France, and
subsequently to James I., Charles I., and Charles II.
of England. As a physician, who had the honour of
attending many crowned heads, he ranks above Caius,
who was physician to Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth—Ambrose
Paré, the inventor of ligatures for
severed arteries, who was physician and surgeon to
Henry II., Francis II., Charles IX., and Henry III.
of France—and Sir Henry Halford, who attended
successively George III., George IV., William IV.,
and Victoria. It is told of Sir Theodore, that when a
friend, after consulting him, foolishly put two broad
gold pieces (six-and-thirty shillings each) on the
table, he quietly pocketed them. The patient, who,
as a friend, expected to have his fee refused, and
therefore (deeming it well to indulge in the magnificence
of generosity when it would cost him nothing)
had absurdly exhibited so large a sum, did not at all
relish the sight of its being netted. His countenance,
if not his tongue, made his mortification manifest.
"Sir," said Sir Theodore, "I made my will this
morning; and if it should appear that I refused a
fee, I might be deemed <i>non compos</i>."</p>

<p>The "Levamen Infirmi," published in 1700, shows
that a century had not, at that date, made much difference
in the scale of remuneration accorded to surgeons
and physicians. "To a graduate in physick,"
this authority states, "his due is about ten shillings,
though he commonly expects or demands twenty.
Those that are only licensed physicians, their due is
no more than six shillings and eight-pence, though
they commonly demand ten shillings. A surgeon's
fee is twelve-pence a mile, be his journey far or near;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
ten groats to set a bone broke, or out of joint; and
for letting blood one shilling; the cutting off or amputation
of any limb is five pounds, but there is no
settled price for the cure." These charges are much
the same as those made at the present day by country
surgeons to their less wealthy patients, with the exception
of a fee for setting a bone, or reducing a dislocation,
which is absurdly out of proportion to the
rest of the sums mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr William Wadd, in his very interesting "Memorabilia,"
states, that the physicians who attended
Queen Caroline had five hundred guineas, and the
surgeons three hundred guineas each; and that Dr.
Willis was rewarded for his successful attendance on
his Majesty King George III., by £1500 per annum
for twenty years, and £650 per annum to his son for
life. The other physicians, however, had only thirty
guineas each visit to Windsor, and ten guineas each
visit to Kew.</p>

<p>These large fees put us in mind of one that ought
to have been paid to Dr. King for his attendance on
Charles the Second. Evelyn relates—"1685, Feb. 4,
I went to London, hearing his Majesty had ben, the
Monday before (2 Feb.), surprised in his bed-chamber
with an apoplectic fit; so that if, by God's providence,
Dr King (that excellent chirurgeon as well as
physitian) had not been actually present, to let his
bloud (having his lancet in his pocket), his Majesty
had certainly died that moment, which might have
ben of direful consequence, there being nobody else
present with the king save this doctor and one more,
as I am assured. It was a mark of the extraordinary
dexterity, resolution, and presence of mind in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Dr to let him bloud in the very paroxysm, without
staying the coming of other physicians, which regularly
should have ben done, and for want of which
he must have a regular pardon, as they tell me."
For this promptitude and courage the Privy-Council
ordered £1000 to be given to Dr. King—but he never
obtained the money.</p>

<p>In a more humourous, but not less agreeable manner,
Dr. Hunter (John Hunter's brother), was disappointed
of payment for his professional services.
On a certain occasion he was suffering under such
severe indisposition that he was compelled to keep
his bed, when a lady called and implored to be admitted
to his chamber for the benefit of his advice. After
considerable resistance on the part of the servants,
she obtained her request; and the sick physician, sitting
up in his bed, attended to her case, and prescribed
for it. "What is your fee, sir?" the lady
asked when the work was done. The doctor, with the
prudent delicacy of his order, informed his patient
that it was a rule with him never to fix his fee; and,
on repeated entreaty that he would depart from his
custom, refused to do so. On this the lady rose from
her seat, and courteously thanking the doctor, left
him—not a little annoyed at the result of his squeamishness
or artifice.</p>

<p>This puts us in mind of the manner in which an
eminent surgeon not long since was defrauded of a
fee, under circumstances that must rouse the indignation
of every honourable man against the delinquent.
Mr. —— received, in his consulting room, a gentleman
of military and prepossessing exterior, who,
after detailing the history of his sufferings, implored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the professional man he addressed to perform for
him a certain difficult and important operation. The
surgeon consented, and on being asked what remuneration
he would require, said that his fee was a hundred
guineas.</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the visitor with some embarrassment,
"I am very sorry to hear you say so. I feel
sure my case without you will terminate fatally; but
I am a poor half-pay officer, in pecuniary difficulties,
and I could not, even if it were to save my soul, raise
half the sum you mention."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," responded the surgeon frankly,
and with the generosity which is more frequently
found amongst medical practitioners than any other
class of men, "don't then disturb yourself. I cannot
take a less fee than I have stated, for my character
demands that I should not have two charges,
but I am at liberty to remit my fee altogether. Allow
me, then, the very great pleasure of attending a retired
officer of the British army gratuitously."</p>

<p>This kindly offer was accepted. Mr. —— not only
performed the operation, but visited his patient
daily for more than three weeks without ever accepting
a guinea—and three months after he had
restored the sick man to health, discovered that, instead
of being in necessitous circumstances, he was
a magistrate and deputy-lieutenant for his county,
and owner of a fine landed estate.</p>

<p>"And, by ——!" exclaimed the fine-hearted surgeon—when
he narrated this disgraceful affair, "I'll
act exactly in the same way to the next poor man who
gives me his <i>word of honour</i> that he is not rich
enough to pay me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>The success of Sir Astley Cooper was beyond that
of any medical practitioner of modern times; but it
came very gradually. His earnings for the first nine
years of his professional career progressed thus:—In
the first year he netted five guineas; in the second,
twenty-six pounds; in the third, sixty-four pounds;
in the fourth, ninety-six pounds; in the fifth, a hundred
pounds; in the sixth, two hundred pounds; in
the seventh, four hundred pounds; in the eighth, six
hundred and ten pounds; and in the ninth, the year
in which he secured his hospital appointment, eleven
hundred pounds. But the time came when the patients
stood for hours in his ante-rooms waiting to
have an interview with the great surgeon, and after
all, their patients were dismissed without being admitted
to the consulting-room. Sir Astley's man,
Charles, with all the dignity that became so eminent
a man's servant, used to say to these disappointed
applicants, in a tone of magnificent patronage, when
they reappeared the next morning after their effectless
visit, "I am not at all sure that <i>we</i> shall be able
to attend to-day to you, gentlemen, for <i>we</i> are excessively
busy, and our list is perfectly full for the day;
but if you'll wait I will see what can be done for
you!"</p>

<p>The highest amount that Sir Astley received in
any one year was £21,000. This splendid income was
an exceptional one. For many years, however, he
achieved more than £15,000 per annum. As long as
he lived in the City after becoming celebrated he
made an enormous, but fluctuating, revenue, the state
of the money-market having an almost laughable
effect on the size of the fees paid him. The capitalists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
who visited the surgeon in Broad Street, in three
cases out of four, paid in cheques, and felt it beneath
their dignity to put pen to paper for a smaller sum
than five guineas. After Sir Astley moved to the
West End he had a more numerous and at the same
time more aristocratic practice; but his receipts were
never so much as they were when he dwelt within
the Lord Mayor's jurisdiction. His more distinguished
patients invariably paid their guineas in
cash, and many of them did not consider it inconsistent
with patrician position to give single fees.
The citizens were the fellows to pay. Mr. William
Coles, of Mincing Lane, for a long period paid Sir
Astley £600 a year, the visits of the latter being principally
made to Mr. Cole's seat near Croydon. Another
"City man," who consulted the surgeon in
Broad Street, and departed without putting down
any honorarium whatever, sent a cheque for £63 10<i>s.</i>,
with the following characteristic note:—</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—When I had first the pleasure of seeing
you, you requested, as a favour, that I would consider
your visit on the occasion as a friend. I now,
sir, must request you will return the compliment by
accepting the enclosed draft as an act of friendship.
It is the profit on £2000 of the ensuing loan, out of
a small sum Sir F. Baring had given, of appropriating
for your chance."</p>

<p>The largest fee Sir Astley Cooper ever received
was paid him by a West Indian millionaire named
Hyatt. This gentleman having occasion to undergo
a painful and perilous operation, was attended by
Drs. Lettsom and Nelson as physicians, and Sir Astley
as chirurgeon. The wealthy patient, his treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
having resulted most successfully, was so delighted
that he fee'd his physicians with 300 guineas each.
"But you, sir," cried the grateful old man, sitting
up in his bed, and speaking to his surgeon, "shall
have something better. There, sir—take <i>that</i>." The
<i>that</i> was the convalescent's night-cap, which he flung
at the dexterous operator. "Sir," replied Sir Astley,
picking up the cap, "I'll pocket the affront." It
was well he did so, for on reaching home he found in
the cap a draft for 1000 guineas. This story has
been told in various ways, but all its tellers agree as
to the amount of the prize.</p>

<p>Catherine, the Empress of Russia, was even more
munificent than the West Indian planter. When Dr.
Dimsdale, for many years a Hertford physician, and
subsequently the parliamentary representative of that
borough, went over to Russia and inoculated the Empress
and her son, in the year 1768, he was rewarded
with a fee of £12,000, a pension for life of £500 per
annum, and the rank of Baron of the Empire. But
if Catherine paid thus handsomely for increased security
of life, a modern emperor of Austria put down
a yet more royal fee for his death-warrant. When
on his death-bed the Emperor Joseph asked Quarin
his opinion of his case, the physician told the monarch
that he could not possibly live forty-eight hours. In
acknowledgment of this frank declaration of the
truth, the Emperor created Quarin a Baron, and gave
him a pension of more than £2000 per annum to
support the rank with.</p>

<p>A goodly collection might be made of eccentric
fees given to the practitioners of the healing art.
William Butler, who, in his moroseness of manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
was the prototype of Abernethy, found (<i>vide</i> Fuller's
"English Worthies") more pleasure in "presents
than money; loved what was pretty rather than what
was costly; and preferred rarities to riches." The
number of physicians is large who have won the
hands of heiresses in the discharge of their professional
avocations. But of them we purpose to speak
at length hereafter. Joshua Ward, the Thames
Street drysalter, who made a fortune by his "Drop
and Pill,"</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Of late, without the least pretence to skill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Ward's grown a famed physician by a pill,"</span>
</div>

<p>was so successfully puffed by Lord Chief Baron
Reynolds and General Churchill, that he was called
in to prescribe for the king. The royal malady disappeared
in consequence, or in spite, of the treatment;
and Ward was rewarded with a solemn vote of
the House of Commons, protecting him from the
interdictions of the College of Physicians; and, as an
additional fee, he asked for, and obtained, the privilege
of driving his carriage through St. James's Park.</p>

<p>The pertinacity with which the members of the
medical profession cling to the shilling of "the
guinea" is amusing. When Erskine used to order
"The Devil's Own" to <i>charge</i>, he would cry out
"Six-and-eightpence!" instead of the ordinary word
of command. Had his Lordship been colonel of a
volunteer corps of physicians, he would have roused
them to an onward march by "A guinea!" Sometimes
patients object to pay the extra shilling over
the sovereign, not less than their medical advisers
insist on having it. "We surgeons do things by
guineas," we recollect a veteran hospital surgeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
saying to a visitor who had put down the largest current
gold piece of our present coinage. The patient
(an irritable old gentleman) made it a question of
principle; he hated humbug—he regarded "that shilling"
as sheer humbug, and he would not pay it. A
contest ensued, which terminated in the eccentric patient
paying, not the shilling, but an additional sovereign.
And to this day he is a frequent visitor of
our surgical ally, and is well content to pay his two
sovereigns, though he would die rather than countenance
"a sham" by putting down "a guinea."</p>

<p>But of all the stories told of surgeons who have
grown fat at the expense of the public, the best is
the following one, for which Mr. Alexander Kellet,
who died at his lodgings in Bath, in the year 1788
is our authority. A certain French surgeon residing
in Georgia was taken prisoner by some Indians, who
having acquired from the French the art of larding
their provisions, determined to lard this particular
Frenchman, and then roast him alive. During the
culinary process, when the man was half larded, the
operators were surprised by the enemy, and their
victim, making his escape, lived many days in the
woods on the bacon he had in his skin.</p>

<p>If full reliance may be placed on the following humorous
verses, it is not unknown for a physician
to be paid in commodities, without the intervention
of the circulating medium, or the receipt of such
creature comforts as Johnson's friendly apothecary
was wont to accept in lieu of cash:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"An adept in the sister arts,<br></span>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>PEDAGOGUES TURNED DOCTORS.</h3>


<p>In the church of St. Mary Magdalen, Taunton, is
a monumental stone engraved with the following inscription:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Qui medicus doctus, prudentis nomine clarus,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Eloquii splendor, Pieridumque decus,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Virtutis cultor, pietatis vixit amicus;<br></span>
<span class="i1">Hoc jacet in tumulo, spiritus alta tenet."</span>
</div>

<p>It is in memory of John Bond, M.A., the learned
commentator on Horace and Persius. Educated at
Winchester school, and then at New College, Oxford,
he was elected master of the Taunton Grammar-school
in the year 1579. For many years he presided over
that seminary with great efficiency, and sent out into
the world several eminent scholars. On arriving,
however, at the middle age of life, he relinquished
the mastership of the school, and turned his attention
to the practice of medicine. His reputation and success
as a physician were great—the worthy people of
Taunton honouring him as "a wise man." He died
August 3, 1612.</p>

<p>More than a century later than John Bond, schoolmaster
and physician, appeared a greater celebrity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
in the person of James Jurin, who, from the position
of a provincial pedagogue, raised himself to be regarded
as first of the London physicians, and conspicuous
amongst the philosophers of Europe. Jurin
was born in 1684, and received his early education
at Christ's Hospital—better known to the public as
the Bluecoat school. After graduating in arts at
Cambridge, he obtained the mastership of the grammar-school
of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, January, 1710.
In the following year he acquired the high academic
distinction of a fellowship on the foundation of Trinity
College; and the year after (1712) he published
through the University press, his edition of Varenius's
Geography, dedicated to Bentley. In 1718
and 1719 he contributed to the Philosophical Transactions
the essays which involved him in controversies
with Keill and Senac, and were, in the year 1732,
reprinted in a collected form, under the title of
"Physico-Mathematical Dissertations." Another of
his important contributions to science was "An Essay
on Distinct and Indistinct Vision," added to Smith's
"System of Optics." Voltaire was not without good
reason for styling him, in the <i>Journal de Savans</i>,
"the famous Jurin."</p>

<p>Besides working zealously in his school, Jurin delivered
lectures at Newcastle, on Experimental Philosophy.
He worked very hard, his immediate object
being to get and save money. As soon as he had laid
by a clear thousand pounds, he left Newcastle, and returning
to his University devoted himself to the study
of medicine. From that time his course was a prosperous
one. Having taken his M.D. degree, he settled
in London, became a Fellow of the College of Physicians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
a Fellow of the Royal Society (to which distinguished
body he became secretary on the resignation
of Dr. Halley in 1721), and a Physician of Guy's
Hospital, as well as Governor of St. Thomas's. The
friend of Sir Isaac Newton and Bentley did not lack
patients. The consulting-rooms and ante-chambers
of his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields received many
visitors; so that he acquired considerable wealth, and
had an estate and an imposing establishment at Clapton.
Nichols speaks of him in one of his volumes as
"James Jurin, M.D., sometime of Clapton in Hackney."
It was, however, at his town residence that
he died, March 22, 1750, of what the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> calls "a dead palsy," leaving by his will a
considerable legacy to Christ's Hospital.</p>

<p>One might make a long list of Doctors Pedagogic,
including poor Oliver Goldsmith, who used to wince
and redden with shame and anger when the cant
phrase, "It's all a holiday at Peckham," saluted his
ears. Between Bond and Jurin, however, there were
two tutors turned physicians, who may not be passed
over without especial attention. Only a little prior to
Jurin they knew many of his friends, and doubtless
met him often in consultation. They were both authors—one
of rare wit, and the other (as he himself
boasted) of no wit; and they hated each other, as literary
men know how to hate. In every respect, even
down to the quarters of town which they inhabited,
they were opposed to each other. One was a brilliant
talker and frequented St. James's; the other was a
pompous drone, and haunted the Mansion-house: a
Jacobite the one, a Whig the other. The reader sees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
that these two worthies can be none other than Arbuthnot
and Blackmore.</p>

<p>A wily, courtly, mirth-loving Scotchman, Arbuthnot
had all the best qualities that are to be ordinarily
found in a child of North Britain. Everybody knew
him—nearly every one liked him. His satire, that
was only rarely tinctured with bitterness—his tongue,
powerful to mimic, flatter, or persuade—his polished
manners and cordial bearing, would alone have made
him a favourite with the ladies, had he not been what
he was—one of the handsomest men about town. (Of
course, in appearance he did not approach that magnificent
gentleman, Beau Fielding). In conversation
he was frank without being noisy; and there hung
about him—tavern-haunting wit though he was—an
air of simplicity, tempering his reckless fun, that was
very pleasant and very winning. Pope, Parnell, Garth,
Gay, were society much more to his taste than the
stately big-wigs of Warwick Hall. And next to drinking
wine with such men, the good-humoured doctor
enjoyed flirting with the maids of honour, and taking
part in a political intrigue. No wonder that Swift
valued him as a priceless treasure—"loved him," as
he wrote to Stella, "ten times as much" as jolly, tippling
Dr. Freind.</p>

<p>It was arm in arm with him that the Dean used to
peer about St. James's, jesting, snarling, laughing,
causing dowagers to smile at "that dear Mr. Dean,"
and young girls, up for their first year at Court—green
and unsophisticated—to blush with annoyance
at his coarse, shameless badinage; bowing to this great
man (from whom he hoped for countenance), staring
insolently at that one (from whom he was sure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
nothing but enmity), quoting Martial to a mitred
courtier (because the prelate couldn't understand
Latin), whispering French to a youthful diplomatist
(because the boy knew no tongue but English), preparing
impromptu compliments for "royal Anna"
(as our dear worthy ancestors used to call Mrs. Masham's
intimate friend), or with his glorious blue eyes
sending a glance, eloquent of admiration and homage,
at a fair and influential supporter; cringing, fawning,
flattering—in fact, angling for the bishopric he
was never to get. With Arbuthnot it was that Swift
tried the dinners and wine of every hotel round
Covent Garden, or in the city. From Arbuthnot it
was that the Dean, during his periods of official exile,
received his best and surest information of the battles
of the cliques, the scandals of the Court, the contentions
of parties, the prospects of ministers, and
(most important subject by far) the health of the
Queen.</p>

<p>Some of the most pleasant pictures in the "Journal
to Stella" are those in which the kindly presence of
the Doctor softens the asperity of the Dean. Most
readers of these pages have accompanied the two
"brothers" in their excursion to the course the day
before the horse-races, when they overtook Miss Forrester,
the pretty maid of honour, and made her accompany
them. The lady was taking the air on her
palfrey, habited in the piquant riding-dress of the
period—the natty three-cornered cocked hat, ornamented
with gold lace, and perched on the top of a
long flowing periwig, powdered to the whiteness of
snow, the long coat cut like a coachman's, the waistcoat
flapped and faced, and lastly the habit-skirt. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
sees the belle at this time smiling archly, with all the
power of beauty, and shaking the handle of her whip
at the divine and the physician. So they took her
with them (and they weren't wrong in doing so).
Then the old Queen came by, gouty and hypochondriac.
Off went the hats of the two courtiers in the
presence of her Majesty. The beauty, too, raised her
little three-cornered cock-boat (rising on her stirrup
as she did so), and returned it to the summit of the
flowing wig, with a knowing side-glance, as much as
to say, "See, sirs, we women can do that sort of thing
quite as gracefully as the lords of the creation." (Oh,
Mr. Spectator, how could you find it in you to quarrel
with that costume?) Swift was charmed, and
described enough of the scene to make that foolish
Stella frantically jealous; and then, prudent, canny
love-tyrant that he was, added with a sneer—"I did
not like her, though she be a toast, and was dressed
like a man." And you may be sure that poor little
Stella was both fool enough and wise enough both to
believe and disbelieve this assurance at the same
time.</p>

<p>Arbuthnot owed his success in no degree whatever
to the influence of his family, and only in a very slight
degree to his professional knowledge. His father
was only a poor episcopalian clergyman, and his M.D.
degree was only an Aberdeen one. He rose by his
wit, rare conversational powers, and fascinating address,
achieving eminence at Court because he was
the greatest master of fence with the weapon that is
most used in courts—the tongue. He failed to get a
living amongst rustic boors, who appreciated no effort
of the human voice but a fox-hunter's whoop. Dorchester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
where as a young man he endeavoured to establish
himself in practice, refused to give him an
income, but it doubtless maintained more than one
dull empiric in opulence. In London he met with a
different reception. For a time he was very poor, and
resorted to the most hateful of all occupations—the
personal instruction of the ignorant. How long he
was so engaged is uncertain. Something of Goldsmith's
"Peckham" sensibility made him not care
in after-life to talk of the days when he was a teacher
of mathematics—starving on pupils until he should
be permitted to grow fat on patients.</p>

<p>The patients were not long in coming. The literary
reputation he obtained by his "Examination of Dr
Woodward's Account of the Deluge," elicited by
Woodward's "Essay towards a Natural History of
the Earth," instead of frightening the sick from him,
brought them to him. Accidentally called in to Prince
George of Denmark, when his Royal Highness was
suddenly taken ill at Epsom, he made himself so
agreeable that the casual introduction became a permanent
connection. In 1709, on the illness of Hannes
(a physician who also understood the art of rising in
spite of obstacles) he was appointed physician-in-ordinary
to Queen Anne.</p>

<p>To secure the good graces of his royal patient, and
rise yet higher in them, he adopted a tone of affection
for her as a person, as well as loyal devotion to her
as a queen. The fall of Radcliffe warned him that
he had need of caution in dealing with the weak-minded,
querulous, crotchety, self-indulgent invalid.</p>

<p>"What's the time?" asked the Queen of him one
day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>"Whatever it may please your Majesty," answered
the court-physician, with a graceful bow.</p>

<p>After all, the best testimony of a man's merit is
the opinion held of him by those of his acquaintance
who know him intimately—at home as well as abroad.
By all who came within the circle of Arbuthnot's
privacy he was respected as much as loved. And his
associates were no common men. Pope, addressing
him as "the friend of his life," says:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Why did I write? what sin, to me unknown,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Dipp'd me in ink?—my parents' or my own?<br></span>
<span class="i0">As yet a child, nor yet a fool to fame,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I lisp'd in numbers, for the numbers came.<br></span>
<span class="i0">I left no calling for this idle trade,<br></span>
<span class="i0">No duty broke, no father disobey'd.<br></span>
<span class="i0">The muse but served to ease some friend, not wife,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To help me through this long disease, my life,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To second, Arbuthnot! thy art and care,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And teach the being you preserved to bear."</span>
</div>

<p>Pope's concluding wish—</p>

<p class="center">
"Oh, friend! may each domestic bliss be thine."<br>
</p>

<p>was ineffectual. Arbuthnot's health failed under his
habits of intemperance, and during his latter years he
was a terrible sufferer from asthma and melancholy.
After the Queen's death he went for the benefit of
his health on the continent, and visited his brother,
a Paris banker. Returning to London he took a house
in Dover Street, from which he moved to the residence
in Cork Street, Burlington Gardens, where he died
Feb. 27, 1734-5. He died in straitened circumstances;
for unlike his fellow-countryman, Colonel
Chartres, he had not the faculty of saving. But with
failing energies, an excruciated frame, and the heart-burden
of a family unprovided for, he maintained a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
philosophic equanimity, and displayed his old unvarying
consideration for all who surrounded him.</p>

<p>Arbuthnot's epitaph on Colonel Chartres (almost
as well known as Martinus Scriblerus) is a good specimen
of his humour:—</p>

<p class="center">
"Here continueth to rot,<br>
The Body of Francis Chartres.<br>
Who, with an indefatigable constancy,<br>
And inimitable Uniformity of life,<br>
Persisted,<br>
In spite of Age and Infirmities,<br>
In the practice of every Human Vice,<br>
Excepting Prodigality and Hypocrisy:<br>
His insatiable Avarice exempting him from the First,<br>
His matchless impudence from the Second.<br>
Nor was he more singular in the Undeviating Pravity<br>
Of his manners, than successful<br>
In accumulating Wealth:<br>
For, without Trade or Profession,<br>
Without trust of public money,<br>
And without bribe-worthy service,<br>
He acquired, or more properly created,<br>
A ministerial estate.<br>
He was the only person of this time<br>
Who could cheat without the Mask of Honesty,<br>
Retain his primæval meanness when possessed of<br>
Ten thousand a-year:<br>
And having duly deserved the Gibbet for what he did,<br>
Was at last condemned to it for what he could not do.<br>
Oh, indignant reader!<br>
Think not his life useless to mankind:<br>
Providence connived at his execrable designs,<br>
To give to After-age a conspicuous<br>
Proof and Example<br>
Of how small estimation is exorbitant Wealth<br>
In the sight of God, by His bestowing it on<br>
The most unworthy of Mortals."<br>
</p>

<p>The history of the worthy person whose reputation
is here embalmed is interesting. Beginning life as an
ensign in the army, he was drummed out of his regiment,
banished Brussels, and ignominiously expelled
from Ghent, for cheating. As a miser he saved, and
as a usurer he increased, the money which he won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
as a blackleg and card-sharper. Twice was he condemned
to death for heinous offences, but contrived to
purchase pardon; and, after all, he was fortunate
enough to die in his own bed, in his native country,
Scotland, <small>A. D.</small> 1731, aged sixty-two. At his funeral
the indignant mob, feeling that justice had not been
done to the dear departed, raised a riot, insulted the
mourners, and, when the coffin was lowered into the
grave, threw upon it a magnificent collection of dead
dogs!</p>

<p>In a similar and scarcely less magnificent vein of
humour, Arbuthnot wrote another epitaph—on a greyhound:—</p>


<p class="center">
"To the memory of<br>
Signor Fido,<br>
An Italian of Good Extraction:<br>
Who came into England,<br>
Not to bite us, like most of his countrymen,<br>
But to gain an honest livelihood:<br>
He hunted not after fame,<br>
Yet acquired it:<br>
Regardless of the Praise of his Friends,<br>
But most sensible of their love:<br>
Tho' he liv'd amongst the great,<br>
He neither learn'd nor flatter'd any vice:<br>
He was no Bigot,<br>
Tho' he doubted of none of the thirty-nine articles;<br>
And if to follow Nature,<br>
And to respect the laws of Society,<br>
Be Philosophy,<br>
He was a perfect Phi losopher,<br>
A faithful Friend,<br>
An agreeable Companion,<br>
A loving Husband,<br>
Distinguished by a numerous Offspring,<br>
All of which he lived to see take good <i>courses</i>;<br>
In his old age he retired<br>
To the House of a Clergyman in the Country,<br>
Where he finished his earthly Race,<br>
And died an Honour and an Example to the whole Species.<br>
Reader,<br>
This stone is guiltless of Flattery,<br>
For he to whom it is inscribed<br>
Was not a man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span><br>
But a<br>
Greyhound."
</p>

<p>In the concluding lines there is a touch of Sterne.
They also call to mind Byron's epitaph on his dog.</p>

<p>These epitaphs put the writer in mind of the literary
ambition of the eminent Dr. James Gregory of
Edinburgh. His great aim was to be <i>the</i> Inscriptor
(as he styled it) of his age. No distinguished person
died without the doctor promptly striking off his characteristics
in a mural legend. For every statue erected
to heroes, real or sham, he composed an inscription,
and interested himself warmly to have it adopted.
Amongst the public monuments on which his
compositions may be found are the Nelson Monument
at Edinburgh, and the Duke of Wellington's shield at
Gibraltar. On King Robert Bruce, Charles Edward
Stuart, his mother, Sir James Foulis de Collington,
and Robertson the historian, he also produced commemorative
inscriptions of great excellence. As a
very fair specimen of his style the inscription on the
Seott Flagon is transcribed:—</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="i8">"Gualterum Scott,<br></span>
<span class="i10">De Abbotsford,<br></span>
<span class="i8">Virum summi Ingenii<br></span>
<span class="i8">Scriptorem Elegantem<br></span>
<span class="i0">Poetarum sui seculi facile Principem<br></span>
<span class="i10">Patriæ Decus<br></span>
<span class="i6">Ob varia ergo ipsam merita<br></span>
<span class="i4">In civium suorum numerum<br></span>
<span class="i0">Grata adscripsit Civitas Edinburgensis<br></span>
<span class="i4">Et hoc Cantharo donavit<br></span>
<span class="i8"><small>A. D. MDCCCXIII</small>."</span>
</p>

<p>Sir Richard Blackmore, the other pedagogue physician,
was one of those good, injudicious mortals who
always either praise or blame too much—usually the
latter. The son of a Wiltshire attorney, he was educated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
at Westminster School and Oxford, taking his
degree of M.A. June, 1676, and residing, in all, thirteen
years in the university, during a portion of which
protracted period of residence he was (though Dr.
Johnson erroneously supposed the reverse) a laborious
student. On leaving Oxford he passed through a
course of searching poverty, and became a schoolmaster.
In this earlier part of his life he travelled in
France, Germany, the Low Countries, and Italy, and
took his doctor's degree in the University of Padua.
On turning his attention to medicine, he consulted
Sydenham as to what authors he ought to read. "Don
Quixote," replied the veteran. A similar answer
has been attributed to Lord Erskine on being asked
by a law student the best literary sources for acquiring
legal knowledge and success. The scepticism
of the reply reminds one of Garth, who, to an anxious
patient inquiring what physician he had best call in
in case of his (Garth's) death, responded, "One is
e'en as good as t'other, and surgeons are not less
knowing."</p>

<p>As a poet, Blackmore failed, but as a physician he
was for many years one of the most successful men
in his profession. Living at Sadler's Hall, Cheapside,
he was the oracle of all the wealthiest citizens, and
was blessed with an affluence that allowed him to drive
about town in a handsome equipage, and make an imposing
figure to the world. Industrious, honourable,
and cordially liked by his personal friends, he was by
no means the paltry fellow that Dryden and Pope
represented him. Johnson, in his brilliant memoir,
treated him very unfairly, and clearly was annoyed
that his conscience would not allow him to treat him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
worse. On altogether insufficient grounds the doctor
argued that his knowledge of ancient authors was
superficial, and for the most part derived from secondary
sources. Passages indeed are introduced to
show that the ridicule and contempt showered on the
poet by his adversaries, and re-echoed by the laughing
world, were unjust; but the effect of these admissions,
complete in themselves, is more than counterbalanced
by the sarcasms (and some of them vulgar
sarcasms too) which the biographer, in imitation of
Colonel Codrington, Sir Charles Sedley, and Colonel
Blount, directs against the city knight.</p>

<p>A sincerely religious man, Blackmore was offended
with the gross licentiousness of the drama, and all
those productions of the poets which constituted the
light literature of the eighteenth century. To his
eternal honour, Blackmore was the first man who had
the courage to raise his voice against the evil, and
give utterance to a manly indignation at the insults
offered nightly in every theatre to public decency.
Unskilled in the use of the pen, of an age when he
could not hope to perfect himself in an art to which
he had not in youth systematically trained himself,
and immersed in the cares of an extensive practice,
he set himself to work on the production of a poem,
which should elevate and instruct, not vitiate and
deprave youthful readers. In this spirit "Prince
Arthur" was composed and published in 1695, when
the author was between forty and fifty years of age.
It was written, as he frankly acknowledged, "by such
catches and starts, and in such occasional uncertain
hours as his profession afforded, and for the greatest
part in coffee-houses, or in passing up and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
streets." The wits laughed at him for writing "to
the rumbling of his chariot-wheels," but at this date,
ridicule thrown on a man for doing good at odd scraps
of a busy day, has a close similarity to the laughter of
fools. Let any reader compare the healthy gentlemanlike
tone of the preface to "Prince Arthur," with
the mean animosity of all the virulent criticisms and
sarcasms that were directed against the author and
his works, and then decide on which side truth and
good taste lie.</p>

<p>Blackmore made the fatal error of writing too
much. His long poems wearied the patience of those
who sympathized with his goodness of intention. What
a list there is of them, in Swift's inscription, "to be
put under Sir Richard's picture!"</p>

<p>Nor is this by any means a complete list of Sir
Richard's works; for he was also a voluminous medical
writer, and author of a "History of the Conspiracy
against the Person and Government of King William
the Third, of glorious memory, in the year
1695."</p>

<p>Dryden, unable to clear himself of the charge of
pandering for gain to the licentious tastes of the age,
responded to his accuser by calling him an "ass," a
"pedant," a "quack," and a "canting preacher."</p>

<span class="i0">Traduced two kings, their kindness to requite;<br></span>
<span class="i0">One made the doctor, and one dubbed the knight."</span>
</div>

<p>The former of the kings alluded to is James the
Second, Blackmore having obtained his fellowship of
the College of Physicians, April 12, 1687, under the
new charter granted to the college by that monarch;
the latter being William the Third, who, in recognition
of the doctor's zeal and influence as a Whig, not
less than of his eminence in his profession, made him
a physician of the household, and knighted him.</p>

<p>Pope says:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The hero William, and the martyr Charles,<br></span>
<span class="i0">One knighted Blackmore, and one pension'd Quarles."</span>
</div>

<p>The bard of Twickenham had of course a few ill
words for Blackmore. In the Dunciad he says:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Ye critics, in whose heads, as equal scales,<br></span>
<span class="i0">I weigh what author's heaviness prevails;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Which most conduce to soothe the soul in slumbers,<br></span>
<span class="i0">My H——ley's periods, or my Blackmore's numbers."</span>
</div>

<p>Elsewhere, in the same poem, the little wasp of
poetry continues his hissing song:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"But far o'er all, sonorous Blackmore's strain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Walls, steeples, skies, bray back to him again.<br></span>
<span class="i0">In Tot'nham fields, the brethren, with amaze,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Prick all their ears up, and forget to graze;<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Long Chancery Lane retentive rolls the sound,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And courts to courts return it round and round;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Thames wafts it thence to Rufus' roaring hall,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And Hungerford re-echoes bawl for bawl;<br></span>
<span class="i0">All hail him victor in both gifts and song,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who sings so loudly, and who sings so long."</span>
</div>

<p>Such being the tone of the generals, the reader can
imagine that of the petty scribblers, the professional
libellers, the coffee-house rakes, and literary amateurs
of the Temple, who formed the rabble of the vast
army against which the doctor had pitted himself, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
defence of public decency and domestic morality. Under
the title of "Commendatory Verses, on the author
of the two Arthurs, and the Satyr against Wit, by
some of his particular friends," were collected, in
the year 1700, upwards of forty sets of ribald verses,
taunting Sir Richard with his early poverty, with his
having been a school-master, with the unspeakable
baseness of—living in the city. The writers of these
wretched dirty lampoons, that no kitchen-maid could
in our day read without blushing, little thought what
they were doing. Their obscene stupidity has secured
for them the lasting ignominy to which they imagined
they were consigning their antagonist. What a crew
they are!—with chivalric Steel and kindly Garth, forgetting
their better natures, and joining in the miserable
riot! To "The City Quack"; "The Cheapside
Knight"; "The Illustrious Quack, Pedant, Bard";
"The Merry Poetaster of Sadler's Hall"—such are
the titles by which they address the doctor, who had
presumed to say that authors and men of wit ought to
find a worthier exercise for their intellects than the
manufacture of impure jests.</p>

<p>Colonel Codrington makes his shot thus—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"By Nature meant, by Want a Pedant made,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Blackmore at first profess'd the whipping trade;<br></span>
<span class="i1"> .    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   .    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   .  &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      .<br></span>

<span class="i0">In vain his drugs as well as Birch he try'd—<br></span>
<span class="i0">His boys grew blockheads, and his patients dy'd.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Next he turn'd Bard, and, mounted on a cart,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hideous rumbling made Apollo start,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Burlesqued the Bravest, Wisest son of Mars,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In ballad rhymes, and all the pomp of Farce.<br></span>
<span class="i1"> .    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   .    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   .  &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      .</span>

</div>

<p>The same dull sarcasms about killing patients and
whipping boys into blockheads are repeated over and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
over again. As if to show, with the greatest possible
force, the pitch to which the evil of the times had
risen, the coarsest and most disgusting of all these
lampoon-writers was a lady of rank—the Countess
of Sandwich. By the side of her Ladyship, Afra Behn
and Mistress Manley become timid blushing maidens.
A better defence of Sir Richard than the Countess's
attack on him it would be impossible to imagine.</p>

<p>And after all—the slander and the maledictions—Sir
Richard Blackmore gained the victory, and the
wits who never wearied of calling him "a fool" were
defeated. The preface to "Prince Arthur" provoked
discussion; the good sense and better taste of the
country were roused, and took the reformer's side of
the controversy. Pope and his myrmidons, it was
true, were still able to make the <i>beau monde</i> merry
about the city knight's presumption—but they could
not refute the city knight's arguments; and they
themselves were compelled to shape their conduct, as
writers, in deference to a new public feeling which he
was an important instrument in calling into existence.
"Prince Arthur" appeared in 1695, and to the commotion
caused by its preface may be attributed much
of the success of Jeremy Collier's "Short View of the
Immorality and Profaneness of the Stage," which
was published some three years afterwards.</p>

<p>As a poet Sir Richard Blackmore can command only
that praise which the charitable bestow on goodness
of intention. His muse was a pleasant, well-looking,
right-minded young lady, but nothing more.
But it must be remembered, before we measure out
our criticisms on his productions, that he never arrogated
to himself the highest honours of poesy. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
am a gentleman of taste and culture, and though I
cannot ever hope to build up the nervous lines of Dryden,
or attain the polish and brilliance of Congreve,
I believe I can write what the generation sorely needs—works
that intelligent men may study with improvement,
devout Christians may read without being offended,
and pure-minded girls may peruse without
blushing from shame. 'Tis true I am a hard-worked
doctor, spending my days in coffee-houses, receiving
apothecaries, or driving over the stones in my carriage,
visiting my patients. Of course a man so circumstanced
must fail to achieve artistic excellence,
but still I'll do my best." Such was the language
with which he introduced himself to the public.</p>

<p>His best poem, <i>The Creation</i>, had such merit that
his carping biographer, Johnson, says, "This poem, if
he had written nothing else, would have transmitted
him to posterity one of the first favourites of the English
muse"; and Addison designated the same poem
"one of the most useful and noble productions in our
English verse."</p>

<p>Of Sir Richard's private character Johnson remarks—"In
some part of his life, it is not known
when, his indigence compelled him to teach a school—a
humiliation with which, though it certainly lasted
but a little while, his enemies did not forget to reproach
him when he became conspicuous enough to excite
malevolence; and let it be remembered, for his
honour, that to have been a schoolmaster is the only
reproach which all the perspicacity of malice, animated
by wit, has ever fixed upon his private life."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE GENEROSITY AND THE PARSIMONY OF
PHYSICIANS.</h3>


<p>Of the generosity of physicians one <i>need</i> say nothing,
for there are few who have not experienced or
witnessed it; and one <i>had better</i> say nothing, as no
words could do justice to such a subject. This writer
can speak for at least one poor scholar, to whose sick-bed
physicians have come from distant quarters of
the town, day after day, never taking a coin for their
precious services, and always in their graceful benevolence
seeming to find positive enjoyment in their unpaid
labour. In gratitude for kindness shown to himself,
and yet more for beneficence exhibited to those
whom he loves, that man of the goose-quill and
thumbed books would like to put on record the names
of certain members of "the Faculty" to whom he is
so deeply indebted. Ah, dear Dr. —— and Dr. —— and
Dr. ——, do not start!—your names shall not be
put down on this cheap common page. Where they
are engraved, you know!</p>

<p>Cynics have been found in plenty to rail at physicians
for loving their fees; and one might justly retort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
on the Cynics, that they love <i>nothing but</i> their fees.
Who doesn't love the sweet money earned by his labour—be
it labour of hand or brain, or both? One
thing is sure—that doctors are underpaid. The most
successful of them in our own time get far less than
their predecessors of any reign, from Harry the
Eighth downwards. And for honours, though the
present age has seen an author raised to the peerage,
no precedent has as yet been established for ennobling
eminent physicians and surgeons.</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth gave her physician-in-ordinary
£100 per annum, besides diet, wine, wax, and other
perquisites. Her apothecary, Hugo Morgan, must too
have made a good thing out of her. For a quarter's
bill that gentleman was paid £83 7<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, a large sum
in those days; but then it was for such good things.
What Queen of England could grudge eleven shillings
for "a confection made like a manus Christi, with
bezoar stone and unicorn's horn"?—sixteen pence
for "a royal sweetmeat with incised rhubarb"?—twelve
pence for "Rosewater for the King of Navarre's
ambassador"?—six shillings for "a conserve
of barberries, with preserved damascene plums, and
other things for Mr. Raleigh"?—two shillings and
sixpence for "sweet scent to be used at the christening
of Sir Richard Knightley's son"?</p>

<p>Coytier, the physician of Charles the XI. of France,
was better paid by far. The extent to which he
fleeced that monarch is incredible. Favour after favour
he wrung from him. When the royal patient
resisted the modest demands of his physician, the latter
threatened him with speedy dissolution. On this
menace the king, succumbing to that fear of death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
which characterized more than one other of his family,
was sure to make the required concession. Theodore
Hook's valet, who was a good servant in the first
year of his service, a sympathizing friend in the second,
and a hard tyrant in the third, was a timid slave
compared with Coytier. Charles, in order to be freed
from his despotism, ordered him to be dispatched. The
officer, intrusted with the task of carrying out the royal
wishes, waited on Coytier, and said, in a most gentlemanlike
and considerate manner, "I am very sorry,
my dear fellow, but I must kill you. The king can't
stand you any longer." "All right," said Coytier,
with perfect unconcern, "whenever you like. What
time would it be most convenient for you to kill me?
But still, I am deuced sorry for his Majesty, for I
know by occult science that he can't outlive me more
than four days." The officer was so struck with the
announcement, that he went away and forthwith imparted
it to the king. "Liberate him instantly—don't
hurt a hair of his head!" cried the terrified monarch.
And Coytier was once again restored to his place in
the king's confidence and pocket.</p>

<p>Henry Atkins managed James the First with some
dexterity. Atkins was sent for to Scotland, to attend
Charles the First (then an infant), who was dangerously
ill of a fever. The king gave him the handsome
fee of £6000. Atkins invested the money in the purchase
of the manor of Clapham.</p>

<p>Radcliffe, with a rare effort of generosity, attended
a friend for a twelvemonth gratuitously. On making
his last visit his friend said, "Doctor, here is a purse
in which I have put every day's fee; and your goodness
must not get the better of my gratitude. Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
your money." Radcliffe looked, made a resolve to
persevere in benevolence, just touched the purse to
reject it, heard the chink of the gold pieces in it, and
put the bag into his pocket. "Singly, sir, I could
have refused them for a twelvemonth; but, all together,
<i>they are irresistible</i>," said the doctor, walking off
with a heavy prize and a light heart.</p>

<p>Louis XIV. gave his physician and his surgeon
75,000 crowns each, after successfully undergoing a
painful and at that time novel operation. By the
side of such munificence, the fees paid by Napoleon I.
to the Faculty who attended Marie Louise in March,
1811, when the Emperor's son was born, seem insufficient.
Dubois, Corvisart, Bourdier, and Ivan were
the professional authorities employed, and they had
among them a remuneration of £4000, £2000 being the
portion assigned to Dubois.</p>

<p>Even more than fee gratefully paid does a humorous
physician enjoy an extra fee adroitly drawn from
the hand of a reluctant payer. Sir Richard Jebb was
once paid three guineas by a nobleman from whom
he had a right to expect five. Sir Richard dropped
the coins on the carpet, when a servant picked them
up and restored them—three, and only three. Instead
of walking off Sir Richard continued his search on
the carpet. "Are all the guineas found?" asked his
Lordship looking round. "There must be two still
on the floor," was the answer, "for I have only
three." The hint of course was taken and the right
sum put down. An eminent Bristol doctor accomplished
a greater feat than this, and took a fee from—a
dead commoner, not a live lord. Coming into his patient's
bed-room immediately after death had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
place, he found the right hand of the deceased tightly
clenched. Opening the fingers he discovered within
them a guinea. "Ah, that was for me—clearly,"
said the doctor putting the piece into his pocket.</p>

<p>Reminding the reader, in its commencement, of Sir
Richard Jebb's disappointment at the three-guinea
fee, the following story may here be appropriately
inserted. A physician on receiving two guineas, when
he expected three, from an old lady patient, who was
accustomed to give him the latter fee, had recourse to
one part of Sir Richard's artifice, and assuming that
the third guinea had been dropt through his carelessness
on the floor, looked about for it. "Nay, nay,"
said the lady with a smile, "you are not in fault. It
is I who dropt it."</p>

<p>There is an abundance of good stories of physicians
fleecing their lambs. To those that are true the comment
may be made—"Doubtless the lambs were all
the better for being shorn." For the following anecdote
we are indebted to Dr. Moore, the author of "Zeluco."
A wealthy tradesman, after drinking the Bath
waters, took a fancy to try the effect of the Bristol hot
wells. Armed with an introduction from a Bath physician
to a professional brother at Bristol, the invalid
set out on his journey. On the road he gave way to
his curiosity to read the doctor's letter of introduction,
and cautiously prying into it read these instructive
words: "Dear sir, the bearer is a fat Wiltshire
clothier—make the most of him."</p>

<p>Benevolence was not a virtue in old Monsey's line;
but he could be generous at another's expense, when
the enjoyment his malignity experienced in paining
one person counterbalanced his discomfort at giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
pleasure to another. Strolling through Oxford market
he heard a poor woman ask the price of a piece of
meat that lay on a butcher's stall.</p>

<p>"A penny a pound!" growled the man to whom
the question was put, disdaining to give a serious
answer to such a poverty-stricken customer.</p>

<p>"Just weigh that piece of beef, my friend," said
Monsey, stepping up.</p>

<p>"Ten pounds and a half, sir," observed the butcher,
after adjusting the scales and weights.</p>

<p>"Here, my good woman," said Monsey, "out with
your apron, and put the beef into it, and make haste
home to your family."</p>

<p>Blessing the benevolent heart of the eccentric old
gentleman, the woman did as she was bid, took possession
of her meat, and was speedily out of sight.</p>

<p>"And there, my man," said Monsey, turning to
the butcher, "is tenpence halfpenny, the price of your
beef."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" demanded the man.</p>

<p>"Simply that that's all I'll pay you. You said the
meat was a penny a pound. At that price I bought
it of you—to give to the poor woman. Good morning!"</p>

<p>A fee that Dr. Fothergill took of Mr. Grenville was
earned without much trouble. Fothergill, like Lettsom,
was a Quaker, and was warmly supported by his
brother sectarians. In the same way Mead was
brought into practice by the Nonconformists, to whom
his father ministered spiritually. Indeed, Mead's satirists
affirmed that when his servant (acting on instructions)
had called him out from divine service,
the parson took his part in the "dodge" by asking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the congregation to pray for the bodily and ghostly
welfare of the patient to whom his son had just been
summoned. Dissenters are remarkable for giving
staunch support, and thorough confidence, to a doctor
of their own persuasion. At the outbreak of the American
war, therefore Grenville knew that he could not
consult a better authority than the Quaker doctor,
Fothergill, on the state of feeling amongst the Quaker
colonists. Fothergill was consequently summoned
to prescribe for the politician. The visit took the form
of an animated discussion on American affairs, which
was brought to a conclusion by Grenville's putting five
guineas into the physician's hand, saying—"Really,
doctor, I am so much better, that I don't want
you to prescribe for me." With a canny significant
smile Fothergill, keeping, like a true Quaker, firm
hold of the money, answered, "At this rate, friend,
I will spare thee an hour now and then."</p>

<p>Dr. Glynn, of Cambridge, was as benevolent as he
was eccentric. His reputation in the fen districts
as an ague doctor was great, and for some years he
made a large professional income. On one occasion
a poor peasant woman, the widowed mother of an
only son, trudged from the heart of the fens into Cambridge,
to consult the doctor about her boy, who was
ill of an ague. Her manner so interested the physician,
that though it was during an inclement winter,
and the roads were almost impassable to carriages,
he ordered horses, and went out to see the sick
lad. After a tedious attendance, and the exhibition
of much port wine and bark (bought at the doctor's
expense), the patient recovered, and Glynn took his
leave. A few days after the farewell visit, the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
woman again presented herself in the consulting
room.</p>

<p>"I hope, my good woman," said Glynn, "your son
is not ill again?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, he was never better," answered the woman,
gratefully; "but we can't get no rest for thinking
of all the trouble that you have had, and so my boy
resolved this morning on sending you his favourite
magpie."</p>

<p>In the woman's hand was a large wicker basket,
which she opened at the conclusion of the speech, affording
means of egress to an enormous magpie, that
hopped out into the room, demure as a saint and bold
as a lord. It was a fee to be proud of!</p>

<p>The free-will offerings of the poor to their doctors
are sometimes very droll, and yet more touching. They
are presented with such fervour and simplicity, and
such a sincere anxiety that they should be taken as
an expression of gratitude for favours past, not for
favours to come. The writer of these pages has known
the humble toilers of agricultural districts retain for
a score of years the memory of kind services done to
them in sickness. He could tell of several who, at the
anniversary of a particular day (when a wife died,
or child was saved from fever, or an accident crushed
a finger or lacerated a limb), trudge for miles over
the country to the doctor's house, and leave there a
little present—a pot of honey, a basket of apples, a
dish of the currants from the bush which "the doctor"
once praised, and said was fit for a gentleman's
garden.</p>

<p>Of eminent physicians Dr. Gregory of Edinburgh
was as remarkable for his amiability as for his learning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
It was his custom to receive from new pupils
at his own house the fees for the privilege of attending
his lectures. Whilst thus engaged one day, he left
a student in his consulting-room, and went into an
adjoining apartment for a fresh supply of admission
tickets. In a mirror the doctor saw the student rise
from his seat, and sweep into his pocket some guineas
from a heap of gold (the fees of other students) that
lay on the consulting-room table. Without saying
a word at the moment, Dr. Gregory returned, dated
the admission ticket, and gave it to the thief. He then
politely attended him to the door, and on the threshold
said to the young man, with deep emotion, "I saw
what you did just now. Keep the money. I know
what distress you must be in. But for God's sake
never do it again—it can never succeed." The pupil
implored Gregory to take back the money, but the
doctor said, "Your punishment is this, you must keep
it—now you have taken it." The reproof had a salutary
effect. The youth turned out a good and honest
man.</p>

<p>An even better anecdote can be told of this good
physician's benevolence. A poor medical student, ill
of typhus fever, sent for him. The summons was attended
to, and the visit paid, when the invalid proffered
the customary guinea fee. Dr. Gregory turned
away, insulted and angry. "I beg your pardon, Dr.
Gregory," exclaimed the student, apologetically, "I
didn't know your rule. Dr. —— has always taken
one." "Oh," answered Gregory, "he has—has he?
Look you, then, my young friend; ask him to meet
me in consultation, and then offer him a fee; or stay—offer
me the fee first." The directions were duly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
acted upon. The consultation took place, and the fee
was offered. "Sir," exclaimed the benevolent doctor,
"do you mean to insult me? Is there a professor who
would in this University degrade himself so far as to
take payment from one of his brotherhood—and a
junior?" The confusion of the man on whom this
reproof was really conferred can be imagined. He
had the decency, ere the day closed, to send back to
the student all the fees he had taken of him.</p>

<p>Amongst charitable physicians a high place must
be assigned to Brocklesby, of whom mention is made
in another part of these pages. An ardent Whig, he
was the friend of enthusiastic Tories as well as of the
members of his own body. Burke on the one hand,
and Johnson on the other, were amongst his intimate
associates, and experienced his beneficence. To the
latter he offered a hundred-a-year for life. And when
the Tory writer was struggling with the heavy burden
of increasing disease, he attended him with affectionate
solicitude, taking no fee for his services—Dr.
Heberden, Dr. Warren, Dr. Butler, and Mr.
Cruikshank the surgeon, displaying a similar liberality.
It was Brocklesby who endeavored to soothe the
mental agitation of the aged scholar's death-bed, by
repeating the passage from the Roman satirist, in
which occurs the line:—</p>

<p>
"Fortem posce animum et mortis terrore carentem."<br>
</p>

<p>Burke's pun on Brocklesby's name is a good instance
of the elaborate ingenuity with which the great
Whig orator adorned his conversation and his speeches.
Pre-eminent amongst the advertising quacks of
the day was Dr. Rock. It was therefore natural that
Brocklesby should express some surprise at being accosted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
by Burke as Dr. Rock, a title at once infamous
and ridiculous. "Don't be offended. Your name is
Rock," said Burke, with a laugh; "I'll prove it algebraically:
<i>Brock—b = Rock</i>; or, Brock less <i>b</i>
makes Rock." Dr. Brocklesby, on the occasion of giving
evidence in a trial, had the ill fortune to offend
the presiding judge, who, amongst other prejudices
not uncommon in the legal profession, cherished a
lively contempt for medical evidence. "Well, gentlemen
of the jury," said the noble lawyer in his summing
up, "what's the medical testimony? First we
have a Dr. Rocklesby or—Brocklesby. What does he
say? <i>First of all he</i> swears—<i>he's a physician</i>."</p>

<p>Abernethy is a by-word for rudeness and even brutality
of manner; but he was as tender and generous
as a man ought to be, as a man of great intelligence
usually is. The stories current about him are nearly
all fictions of the imagination; or, where they have
any foundation in fact, relate to events that occurred
long before the hero to whom they are tacked by anecdote-mongers
had appeared on the stage. He was eccentric—but
his eccentricities always took the direction
of common sense; whereas the extravagances attributed
to him by popular gossip are frequently those
of a heartless buffoon. His time was precious, and
he rightly considered that his business was to set his
patients in the way of recovering their lost health—not
to listen to their fatuous prosings about their maladies.
He was therefore prompt and decided in checking
the egotistic garrulity of valetudinarians. This
candid expression of his dislike to unnecessary talk
had one good result. People who came to consult him
took care not to offend him by bootless prating. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
lady on one occasion entered his consulting-room,
and put before him an injured finger, without saying
a word. In silence Abernethy dressed the wound,
when instantly and silently the lady put the usual
fee on the table, and retired. In a few days she called
again, and offered the finger for inspection. "Better?"
asked the surgeon. "Better," answered the
lady, speaking to him for the first time. Not another
word followed during the rest of the interview. Three
or four similar visits were made, at the last of which
the patient held out her finger free from bandages and
perfectly healed. "Well?" was Abernethy's monosyllabic
inquiry. "Well," was the lady's equally brief
answer. "Upon my soul, madam," exclaimed the delighted
surgeon, "<i>you are the most rational woman I
ever met with</i>."</p>

<p>To curb his tongue, however, out of respect to
Abernethy's humour, was an impossibility to John
Philpot Curran. Eight times Curran (personally unknown
to Abernethy) had called on the great surgeon;
and eight times Abernethy had looked at the
orator's tongue (telling him, by-the-by, that it was
the most unclean and utterly abominable tongue in
the world), had curtly advised him to drink less, and
not abuse his stomach with gormandizing, had taken
a guinea, and had bowed him out of the room. On
the ninth visit, just as he was about to be dismissed
in the same summary fashion, Curran, with a flash of
his dark eye, fixed the surgeon, and said—"Mr.
Abernethy, I have been here on eight different days,
and I have paid you eight different guineas; but you
have never yet listened to the symptoms of my complaint.
I am resolved, sir, not to leave the room till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
you satisfy me by doing so." With a good-natured
laugh, Abernethy, half suspecting that he had to deal
with a madman, fell back in his chair and said—"Oh!
very well, sir; I am ready to hear you out. Go on,
give me the whole—your birth, parentage, and education.
I wait your pleasure. Pray be as minute and
tedious as you can." With perfect gravity Curran
began—"Sir, my name is John Philpot Curran. My
parents were poor, but I believe honest people, of the
province of Munster, where also I was born, at Newmarket,
in the county of Cork, in the year one thousand
seven hundred and fifty. My father being employed
to collect the rents of a Protestant gentleman
of small fortune, in that neighbourhood, procured my
admission into one of the Protestant free-schools,
where I obtained the first rudiments of my education.
I was next enabled to enter Trinity College, Dublin,
in the humble sphere of a sizar—" And so he went
steadily on, till he had thrown his auditor into convulsions
of laughter.</p>

<p>Abernethy was very careful not to take fees from
patients if he suspected them to be in indigent circumstances.
Mr. George Macilwain, in his instructive and
agreeable "Memoirs of John Abernethy," mentions a
case where an old officer of parsimonious habits, but
not of impoverished condition, could not induce Abernethy
to accept his fee, and consequently forbore
from again consulting him. On another occasion,
when a half-pay lieutenant wished to pay him for a
long and laborious attendance, Abernethy replied,
"Wait till you're a general; then come and see me,
and we'll talk about fees." To a gentleman of small
means who consulted him, after having in vain had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
recourse to other surgeons, he said—"Your recovery
will be slow. If you don't feel much pain, depend
upon it you are gradually getting round; if you do
feel much pain, then come again, <i>but not else</i>. I don't
want your money." To a hospital student (of great
promise and industry, but in narrow circumstances),
who became his dresser, he returned the customary fee
of sixty guineas, and requested him to expend them in
the purchase of books and securing other means of
improvement. To a poor widow lady (who consulted
him about her child), he, on saying good-bye in a
friendly letter, returned all the fees he had taken
from her under the impression that she was in good
circumstances, and added £50 to the sum, begging her
to expend it in giving her child a daily ride in the
fresh air. He was often brusque and harsh, and more
than once was properly reproved for his hastiness and
want of consideration.</p>

<p>"I have heard of your rudeness before I came, sir,"
one lady said, taking his prescription, "but I was not
prepared for such treatment. What am I to do with
this?"</p>

<p>"Anything you like," the surgeon roughly answered.
"Put it on the fire if you please."</p>

<p>Taking him at his word, the lady put her fee on
the table, and the prescription on the fire; and making
a bow, left the room. Abernethy followed her into the
hall, apologizing, and begging her to take back the fee
or let him write another prescription; but the lady
would not yield her vantage-ground.</p>

<p>Of operations Abernethy had a most un-surgeon-like
horror—"like Cheselden and Hunter, regarding
them as the reproach of the profession." "I hope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
sir, it will not be long," said a poor woman, suffering
under the knife. "No, indeed," earnestly answered
Abernethy, "that would be too horrible." This
humanity, on a point on which surgeons are popularly
regarded as being devoid of feeling, is very general
in the profession. William Cooper (Sir Astley's
uncle) was, like Abernethy, a most tender-hearted
man. He was about to amputate a man's leg, in the
hospital theatre, when the poor fellow, terrified at the
display of instruments and apparatus, suddenly
jumped off the table, and hobbled away. The students
burst out laughing; and the surgeon, much
pleased at being excused from the performance of a
painful duty, exclaimed, "By God, I am glad he's
gone!"</p>

<p>The treatment which one poor fellow received from
Abernethy may at first sight seem to militate against
our high estimate of the surgeon's humanity, and dislike
of inflicting physical pain. Dr. ——, an eminent
physician still living and conferring lustre on his profession,
sent a favourite man-servant with a brief
note, running—"Dear Abernethy, Will you do me
the kindness to put a seton in this poor fellow's neck?
Yours sincerely, ——." The man, who was accustomed
and encouraged to indulge in considerable
freedom of speech with his master's friends, not only
delivered the note to Abernethy, but added, in an explanatory
and confiding tone, "You see, sir, I don't
get better, and as master thinks I ought to have a
seton in my neck, I should be thankful if you'd put it
in for me." It is not at all improbable that Abernethy
resented the directions of master and man.
Anyhow he inquired into the invalid's case, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
taking out his needles did as he was requested. The
operation was attended with a little pain, and the man
howled, as only a coward can howl, under the temporary
inconvenience. "Oh! Lor' bless you! Oh, have
mercy on me! Yarra—yarra—yarr! Oh, doctor—doctor—you'll
kill me!" In another minute the surgeon's
work was accomplished, and the acute pain
having passed away, the man recovered his self-possession
and impudence.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, sir, I do hope, now that it's done, it'll do
me good. I do hope that."</p>

<p>"But it won't do you a bit of good."</p>

<p>"What, sir, no good?" cried the fellow.</p>

<p>"No more good," replied Abernethy, "than if I
had spat upon it."</p>

<p>"Then, sir—why—oh, yarr! here's the pain again—why
did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Confound you, man!" answered the surgeon testily.
"Why did I do it?—why, <i>didn't you ask me to
put a seton in your neck</i>?"</p>

<p>Of course the surgical treatment employed by Abernethy
in this case was the right one; but he was so
nettled with the fellow's impudence and unmanly
lamentations, that he could not forbear playing off
upon him a barbarous jest.</p>

<p>If for this outbreak of vindictive humour the
reader is inclined to call Abernethy a savage, let his
gift of £50 to the widow lady, to pay for her sick
child's carriage exercise, be remembered. <i>Apropos</i> of
£50, Dr. Wilson of Bath sent a present of that sum to
an indigent clergyman, against whom he had come in
the course of practice. The gentleman who had engaged
to convey the gift to the unfortunate priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
said, "Well, then, I'll take the money to him to-morrow."
"Oh, my dear sir," said the doctor, "take it
to him to-night. Only think of the importance to a
sick man of one good night's rest!"</p>

<p>Side by side with stories of the benevolence of "the
Faculty," piquant anecdotes of their stinginess might
be told. This writer knew formerly a grab-all-you-can-get
surgeon, who was entertaining a few professional
brethren at a Sunday morning's breakfast,
when a patient was ushered into the ante-room of the
surgeon's bachelor chambers, and the surgeon himself
was called away to the visitor. Unfortunately he
left the folding-doors between the breakfast-room and
the ante-room ajar, and his friends sitting in the former
apartment overheard the following conversation:</p>

<p>"Well, my friend, what's the matter?"—the surgeon's
voice.</p>

<p>The visitor's voice—"Plaze, yer honner, I'm a pore
Hirish labourer, but I can spill a bit, and I read o'
yer honner's moighty foine cure in the midical jarnal—the
<i>Lancet</i>. And I've walked up twilve miles to
have yer honner cure me. My complaint is ——"</p>

<p>Surgeon's voice, contemptuously—"Oh, my good
man, you've made a mistake. You'd better go to
the druggist's shop nearest your home, and he'll do
for you all you want. You couldn't pay me as I
require to be paid."</p>

<p>Visitor's voice, proudly and triumphantly—"Och,
an' little ye know an Irish gintleman, dochter, if ye
think he'd be beholden to the best of you for a feavor.
Here's a bit o' gould—nocht liss nor a tin shillin'
piece, but I've saved it up for ye, and ye'll heve the
whole, tho' its every blissed farthing I hev."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>The surgeon's voice altered. The case was gone
into. The prescription was written. The poor Irish
drudge rose to go, when the surgeon, with that delicate
quantity of conscience that rogues always have
to make themselves comfortable upon, said, "Now,
you say you have no more money, my friend. Well,
the druggist will charge you eighteenpence for the
medicine I have ordered there. So there's eighteenpence
for you out of your half-sovereign."</p>

<p>We may add that this surgeon was then, at a moderate
computation, making three thousand a year.
We have heard of an Old Bailey barrister boasting
how he wrung the shillings (to convert the sovereigns
already paid with his brief into guineas) from the
grimed hands of a prisoner actually standing in the
dock for trial, ere he would engage to defend him.
But compared with this surgeon the man of the long
robe was a disinterested friend of the oppressed.</p>

<p>A better story yet of a surgeon who seized on his
fee like a hawk. A clergyman of ——shire, fell from
a branch of a high pear-tree to the grass-plot of the
little garden that surrounded his vicarage-house, and
sustained, besides being stunned, a compound fracture
of the right arm. His wife, a young and lovely creature,
of a noble but poor family, to whom he had been
married only three or four years, was terribly
alarmed, and without regulating her conduct by considerations
of her pecuniary means, dispatched a telegraphic
message to an eminent London surgeon. In
the course of three or four hours the surgeon made
his appearance, and set the broken limb.</p>

<p>"And what, sir," the young wife timidly asked of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the surgeon, when he had come down-stairs into her
little drawing-room, "is your fee?"</p>

<p>"Oh, let's see—distance from town, hundred miles.
Yes. Then my fee is a hundred guineas!"</p>

<p>Turning deadly pale with fright (for the sum was
ten times the highest amount the poor girl had
thought of as a likely fee) she rose, and left the
room, saying, "Will you be kind enough to wait for a
few minutes?"</p>

<p>Luckily her brother (like her husband, a clergyman,
with very moderate preferment) was in the
house, and he soon made his appearance in the drawing-room.
"Sir," said he, addressing the operator,
"my sister has just now been telling me the embarrassment
she is in, and I think it best to repeat her
story frankly. She is quite inexperienced in money
matters, and sent for you without ever asking what
the ordinary fee to so distinguished a surgeon as yourself,
for coming so far from London, might be. Well,
sir, it is right you should know her circumstances.
My brother-in-law has no property but his small living,
which does not yield him more than £400 per
annum, and he has already two children. My sister
has no private fortune whatever, at present, and all
she has in prospect is the reversion of a trifling sum—at
a distant period. Poverty is the only stigma that
time has fixed upon my family. Now, sir, under the
circumstances, if professional etiquette would allow
of your reducing your fee to the straitened finances
of my sister, it really would—would be—"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear sir," returned the surgeon, in a rich,
unctuous voice of benevolence, "pray don't think I'm
a shark. I am really deeply concerned for your poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
sister. As for my demand of <i>a hundred guineas</i>,
since it would be beyond her means to satisfy it, why,
my dear sir, I shall be only too delighted to be allowed—<i>to
take a hundred pounds</i>!"</p>

<p>The fee-loving propensities of doctors are well illustrated
by the admirable touches of Froissart's
notice of Guyllyam of Harseley, who was appointed
physician to Charles the Sixth, King of France, during
his derangement. The writer's attention was first
called to Friossart's sketch of the renowned mad-doctor
by his friend Mr. Edgar—a gentleman whose
valuable contributions to historical literature have
endeared his name to both young and old. Of the
measures adopted by Guyllyam for the king's cure
the readers of Froissart are not particularly informed;
but it would appear, from the physician's
parting address to the "dukes of Orlyance, Berrey,
Burgoyne, and Burbone," that his system was, in its
enlightened humanity, not far behind that adopted at
the present day by Dr. Conolly and Dr. Forbes
Winslow. But, however this may be, Guyllyam's
labours must be regarded as not less consonant with
sound nosological views than those of the afflicted
monarch's courtiers, until it can be shown that his
treatment was worse than leaving Nature to herself.
"They," says Froissart, "that were about the kynge
sente the kynge's offrynge to a town called Aresneche,
in the countie of Heynaulte, between Cambrey and
Valancennes, in the whiche towne there was a churche
parteyning to an Abbey of Saynt Waste in Arrasce
wherein there lyeth a saynte, called Saynt Acquayre,
of whom there is a shrine of sylver, which pylgrimage
is sought farre and nere for the malady of the fransey;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
thyder was sent a man of waxe, representynge
the Frenche Kynge, and was humbly offred to the
Saynt, that he might be meane to God, to asswage
the kynge's malady, and to sende him helthe. In
lykewise the kynge's offrynge was sent to Saynt Hermyer
in Romayes, which saynt had meryte to heal the
fransey. And in lykewise offrynges were sent into
other places for ye same entent."</p>

<p>The conclusion of Guyllyam's attendance is thus
described:—"Trewe it is this sycknesse that the kyng
took in the voyage towards Bretagne greatly abated
the ioye of the realme of France, and good cause why,
for when the heed is sicke the body canne have no
ioye. No man durste openly speke thereof, but kepte
it privy as moche as might be, and it was couertly
kept fro the queene, for tyll she was delyuered and
churched she knewe nothynge thereof, which tyme
she had a doughter. The physician, myster Guyllyam,
who had the chefe charge of healynge of the
kynge, was styll aboute hym, and was ryght dyligent
and well acquyted hymselfe, whereby he gate bothe
honour and profyte; for lytell and lytell he brought
the kynge in good estate, and toke away the feuer and
the heate, and made hym to haue taste and appetyte
to eate and drinke, slepe and rest, and knowledge of
every thynge; howebeit, he was very feble, and lytell
and lytell he made the kynge to ryde a huntynge and
on hawkynge; and whanne tydynges was knowen
through France howe the kynge was well mended, and
had his memory again, every man was ioyfull and
thanked God. The kynge thus beyng at Crayell, desyred
to se the quene his wyfe and the dolphyn his
sonne; so the quene came thyder to hym, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
chylde was brought thyder, the kynge made them
good chere, and so lytell and lytell, through the helpe
of God, the kynge recouered his helthe. And when
mayster Guyllyam sawe the kynge in so good case he
was ryght ioyfull, as reasone was, for he hade done
a fayre cure, and so delyuered him to the dukes of
Orlyance, Berrey, Burgoyne, and Burbone, and sayd:
'My lordes, thanked be God, the kynge is nowe in
good state and helth, so I delyuer him, but beware
lette no mane dysplease hym, for as yet his spyrytes
be no fully ferme nor stable, but lytell and lytell he
shall waxe stronge; reasonable dysporte, rest, and
myrthe shall be moste profytable for hym; and
trouble hym as lytell as may be with any counsayles,
for he hath been sharpely handeled with a hote
malady.' Than it was consydred to retaygne this
mayster Guyllyam, and to gyve hym that he shulde
be content with all, <i>whiche is the ende that all physicians
requyre, to haue gyftes and rewardes</i>; he was
desyred to abyde styll about the kynge, but he excused
hymselfe, and sayd howe he was an olde impotent
man, and coulde note endure the maner of

after, for whan he retournd to the cytie of Laon,
there he contynued and dyed a ryche man: he left
behynde him a xxx thousand frankes. All his dayes
he was one of the greatest nygardes that ever was:

for in his howse he neuer spente past two souses

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>BLEEDING.</h3>


<p>Fashion, capricious everywhere, is especially so in
surgery and medicine. Smoking we are now taught
to regard as a pernicious practice, to be abhorred
as James the First abhorred it. Yet Dr. Archer, and
Dr. Everard in his "Panacea, or a Universal Medicine,
being a discovery of the wonderful virtues of
Tobacco" (1659), warmly defended the habit, and for
long it was held by the highest authorities to be an
efficacious preservative against disease. What would
schoolboys now say to being flogged for <i>not</i> smoking?
Yet Thomas Hearne, in his diary (1720-21) writes—"Jan.
21, I have been told that in the last great
plague in London none that kept tobacconists' shops
had the plague. It is certain that smoking was looked
upon as a most excellent preservative. In so much,
that even children were obliged to smoak. And I remember
that I heard formerly Tom Rogers, who was
yeoman beadle, say, that when he was that year, when
the plague raged, a school-boy at Eton, all the boys of
that school were obliged to smoak in the school every
morning, and that he was never whipped so much in
his life as he was one morning for not smoaking."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>Blood-letting, so long a popular remedy with physicians,
has, like tobacco-smoking for medicinal purposes,
fallen into disuse and contempt. From Hippocrates
to Paracelsus, who, with characteristic daring,
raised some objections to the practice of venesection,
doctors were in the habit of drawing disease from the
body as vintners extract claret from a cask, in a ruddy
stream. In the feudal ages bleeding was in high
favour. Most of the abbeys had a "flebotomaria" or
"bleeding-house," in which the sacred inmates underwent
bleedings (or "minutions" as they were
termed) at stated periods of the year, to the strains of
psalmody. The brethren of the order of St. Victor
underwent five munitions annually—in September,
before Advent, before Lent, after Easter, and at Pentecost.</p>

<p>There is a good general view of the superstitions
and customs connected with venesection, in "The Salerne
Schoole," a poem of which mention continually
occurs in the writings of our old physicians. The

<p>Wadd mentions an old surgical writer who divides
his chapter on bleeding under such heads as the following:—1.
What is to limit bleeding? 2. Qualities
of an able phlebotomist; 3. Of the choice of instruments;
4. Of the band and bolster; 5. Of porringers;
6. <i>Circumstances to be considered at the bleeding of a
Prince.</i></p>

<p>Simon Harward's "Phlebotomy, or Treatise of Letting
of Bloud; fitly serving, as well for an advertisement
and remembrance to all well-minded chirurgians,
as well also to give a caveat generally to all men
to beware of the manifold dangers which may ensue
upon rash and unadvised letting of bloud," published
in the year 1601, contains much interesting matter on
the subject of which it treats. But a yet more amusing
work is one that Nicholas Gyer wrote and published
in 1592, under the following title:—</p>

<p>"The English Phlebotomy; or, Method and Way of
Healing by Letting of Bloud."</p>

<p>On the title-page is a motto taken from the book of
Proverbs—"The horse-leach hath two daughters,
which crye, 'give, give.'"</p>

</div>

<p>The work affords some valuable insight into the
social status of the profession in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>
In his dedicatory letter to Master Reginald Scot,
Esquire, the author says that phlebotomy "is greatly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
abused by vagabund horse-leaches and travailing
tinkers, who find work almost in every village through
whom it comes (having in truth neither knowledge,
nor witte, nor honesty), the sober practitioner and
cunning chirurgian liveth basely, is despised, and accounted
a very abject amongst the vulgar sort." Of
the medical skill of Sir Thomas Eliot, and Drs. Bulleyn,
Turner, Penié, and Coldwel, the author speaks
in terms of warm eulogy; but as for the tinkers aforementioned,
he would regard them as murderers, and
"truss them up at Tyborne."</p>

<p>Gyer, who indulges in continual reference to the
"Schola Salerni," makes the following contribution
to the printed metrical literature on Venesection:—</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Certaine very old English verses, concerning the veines and
letting of bloud, taken out of a very auncient paper book
of Phisicke notes</i>:—</p></blockquote>

<p>To bleed on May-day is still the custom with ignorant
people in a few remote districts. The system
of vernal minutions probably arose from that tendency
in most men to repeat an act (simply because
they have done it once) until it has become a habit,
and then superstitiously to persevere in the habit,
simply because it is a habit. How many aged people
read certain antiquated journals, as they wear exploded
garments, for no other reason than that they
read the same sort of literature, and wore the same
sort of habiliments, when young. To miss for once
the performance of a periodically recurring duty,
and so to break a series of achievements, would worry
many persons, as the intermitted post caused Dr. Johnson
discomfort till he had returned and touched it.
As early as the sixteenth century, we have Gyer combating
the folly of people having recourse to periodic
venesections. "There cometh to my minde," he says,
"a common opinion among the ignorant people, which
do certainly beleeve that, if any person be let bloud
one yere, he must be let bloud every yere, or else he
is (I cannot tell, nor they neither) in how great danger.
Which fonde opinion of theirs, whereof soever
the same sprong first, it is no more like to be true,
than if I should say: when a man hath received a
great wound by chaunce in any part of his body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
whereby he loseth much bloud; yet after it is healed,
he must needs have the like wounde againe there the
next yeare, to avoid as much bloud, or els he is in
daunger of great sickness, yea, and also in hazard to
lose his life."</p>

<p>The practitioners of phlebotomy, and the fees paid
for the operation, have differed widely. In the middle
of the last century a woman used the lancet with
great benefit to her own pocket, if not to her patients,
in Marshland, in the county of Norfolk. What
her charge was is unknown, probably, however, only
a few pence. A distinguished personage of the same
period (Lord Radnor) had a great fondness for letting
the blood (at the point of an amicable lancet—not
a hostile sword) of his friends. But his Lordship,
far from accepting a fee, was willing to remunerate
those who had the courage to submit to his surgical
care. Lord Chesterfield, wanting an additional
vote for a coming division in the House of Peers,
called on Lord Radnor, and, after a little introductory
conversation, complained of a distressing headache.</p>

<p>"You ought to lose blood then," said Lord Radnor.</p>

<p>"Gad—do you indeed think so? Then, my dear
lord, do add to the service of your advice by performing
the operation. I know you are a most skilful surgeon."</p>

<p>Delighted at the compliment, Lord Radnor in a
trice pulled out his lancet-case, and opened a vein in
his friend's arm.</p>

<p>"By-the-by," asked the patient, as his arm was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
being adroitly bound up, "do you go down to the
House to-day?"</p>

<p>"I had not intended going," answered the noble
operator, "not being sufficiently informed on the
question which is to be debated; but you, that have
considered it, which side will you vote on?"</p>

<p>In reply, Lord Chesterfield unfolded his view of
the case; and Lord Radnor was so delighted with
the reasoning of the man (who held his surgical
powers in such high estimation), that he forthwith
promised to support the wily earl's side in the division.</p>

<p>"I have shed my blood for the good of my country,"
said Lord Chesterfield that evening to a party
of friends, who, on hearing the story, were convulsed
with laughter.</p>

<p>Steele tells of a phlebotomist who advertised, for
the good of mankind, to bleed at "threepence per
head." Trade competition has, however, induced
practitioners to perform the operation even without
"the threepence." In the <i>Stamford Mercury</i> for
March 28, 1716, the following announcement was
made:—"Whereas the majority of apothecaries in
Boston have agreed to pull down the price of bleeding
to sixpence, let these certifie that Mr Clarke,
apothecary, will bleed anybody at his shop <i>gratis</i>."</p>

<p>The readers of Smollett may remember in one of
his novels the story of a gentleman, who, falling
down in his club in an apoplectic fit, was immediately
made the subject of a bet between two friendly
bystanders. The odds were given and accepted
against the sick man's recovery, and the wager was
duly registered, when a suggestion was made by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
more humane spectator that a surgeon ought to be
sent for. "Stay," exclaimed the good fellow interested
in having a fatal result to the attack, "if he is
let blood, or interfered with in any way, the bet
doesn't hold good." This humorous anecdote may be
found related as an actual occurrence in Horace Walpole's
works. It was doubtless one of the "good
stories" current in society, and was so completely
public property, that the novelist deemed himself
entitled to use it as he liked. In certain recent books
of "ana" the incident is fixed on Sheridan and the
Prince Regent, who are represented as the parties to
the bet.</p>

<p>Elsewhere mention has been made of a thousand
pounds <i>ordered</i> to be paid Sir Edmund King for
promptly bleeding Charles the Second. A nobler fee
was given by a French lady to a surgeon, who used
his lancet so clumsily that he cut an artery instead
of a vein, in consequence of which the lady died.
On her death-bed she, with charming humanity and
irony, made a will, bequeathing the operator a life annuity
of eight hundred livres, on condition "that
he never again bled anybody so long as he lived."
In the <i>Journal Encylopédique</i> of Jan. 15, 1773, a
somewhat similar story is told of a Polish princess,
who lost her life in the same way. In her will, made
<i>in extremis</i>, there was the following clause:—"Convinced
of the injury that my unfortunate accident
will occasion to the unhappy surgeon who is the cause
of my death, I bequeath to him a life annuity of
two hundred ducats, secured by my estate, and forgive
his mistake from my heart: I wish this may indemnify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
him for the discredit which my sorrowful
catastrophe will bring upon him."</p>

<p>A famous French Maréchal reproved the clumsiness
of a phlebotomist in a less gratifying manner.
Drawing himself away from the bungling operator,
just as the incision was about to be made, he displayed
an unwillingness to put himself further in the power
of a practitioner, who, in affixing the fillet, had given
him a blow with the elbow in the face.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said the surgeon, "it seems that you
are afraid of the bleeding."</p>

<p>"No," returned the Maréchal, "not of the bleeding—but
the bleeder."</p>

<p>Monsieur, brother of Louis XIV., had an insuperable
aversion to the operation, however dexterous might
be the operator. At Marly, while at table with the
King, he was visited with such ominous symptoms,
that Fochon, the first physician of the court, said—"You
are threatened with apoplexy, and you cannot
be too soon blooded."</p>

<p>But the advice was not acted on, though the King
entreated that it might be complied with.</p>

<p>"You will find," said Louis, "what your obstinacy
will cost you. We shall be awoke some of these nights
to be told that you are dead."</p>

<p>The royal prediction, though not fulfilled to the
letter, soon proved substantially true. After a gay
supper at St. Cloud, Monsieur, just as he was about
to retire to bed, quitted the world. He was asking
M. de Ventadour for a glass of liqueur sent him by the
Duke of Savoy, when he dropped down dead. Anyhow
Monsieur went out of this life thinking of
something nice. The Marquis of Hertford, with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
his deliberation, could not do more.</p>

<p>The excess to which the practice of venesection was
carried in the last century is almost beyond belief.
The <i>Mercure de France</i> (April, 1728, and December,
1729) gives the particulars of the illness of a woman
named Gignault. She was aged 24 years, was the
wife of an hussar, and resided at St. Sauge, a town
of the Nivernois. Under the direction of Monsieur
Theveneau, Seigneur de Palmery, M.D., of St. Sauge,
she was bled three thousand nine hundred and four
times in nine months (<i>i. e.</i> from the 6th of September,
1726, to the 3rd of June, 1727). By the 15th of July,
in the same year, the bleedings numbered four thousand
five hundred and fifty-five. From the 6th of
September, 1726, to the 1st of December, 1729, the
blood-lettings amounted to twenty-six thousand two
hundred and thirty. Did this really occur? Or was
the editor of the <i>Mercure de France</i> the original Baron
Munchausen?</p>

<p>Such an account as the above ranges us on the side
of the German physician, who petitioned that the use
of the lancet might be made penal. Garth's epigram
runs:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Like a pert skuller, one physician plies,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And all his art and all his skill he tries;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But two physicians, like a pair of oars,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Conduct you faster to the Stygian shores."</span>
</div>

<p>It would, however, be difficult to imagine a quicker
method to destroy human life than that pursued by
Monsieur Theveneau. A second adviser could hardly
have accelerated his movements, or increased his
determination not to leave his reduced patient a
chance of recovery.</p>

<p>"A rascal," exclaimed a stout, asthmatic old gentleman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
to a well-dressed stranger on Holborn Hill—"a
rascal has stolen my hat. I tried to overtake him—and
I'm—so—out of breath—I can't stir another
inch." The stranger eyed the old gentleman, who
was panting and gasping for hard life, and then
pleasantly observing, "Then I'm hanged, old boy, if
I don't have your wig," scampered off, leaving his
victim bald as a baby. M. Theveneau was the two
thieves in one. He first brought his victim to a state
of helplessness, and then "carried out his little system."
It would be difficult to assign a proper punishment
to such a stupid destroyer of human life.
Formerly, in the duchy of Wurtemberg, the public
executioner, after having sent out of the world a certain
number of his fellow-creatures, was dignified
with the degree of doctor of physic. It would not be
otherwise than well to confer on such murderous physicians
as M. Theveneau the honorary rank of hangman
extraordinary.</p>

<p>The incomes that have been realized by blood-letting
alone are not less than those which, in the present
day, are realized by the administration of chloroform.
An eminent phlebotomist, not very many years since,
made a thousand per annum by the lancet.</p>

<p>About blood-letting—by the lancet, leeches, and
cupping (or <i>boxing</i>, as it was called in Elizabeth's
days, and much later)—the curious can obtain many
interesting particulars in our old friend Bulleyn's
works.</p>

<p>To open a vein has for several generations been
looked on as beneath the dignity of the leading professors
of medicine or surgery. In some cases
phlebotomy was practised as a sort of specialty by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
surgeons of recognised character: but generally, at
the close of the last century, it was left, as a branch of
practice, in the hands of the apothecary. The occasions
on which physicians have of late years used the
lancet are so few, that it is almost a contribution to
medical gossip to bring up a new instance. One of
the more recent cases of a notability being let blood
by a physician, was when Sir Lucas Pepys, on Oct. 2,
1806, bled the Princess of Wales. On that day, as
her Royal Highness was proceeding to Norbury Park,
to visit Mr. Locke, in a barouche drawn by four
horses, the carriage was upset at Leatherhead. Of
the two ladies who accompanied the Princess, one
(Lady Sheffield) escaped without a bruise, but the
other (Miss Cholmondley) was thrown to the ground
and killed on the spot. The injuries sustained by the
Princess were very slight, but Sir Lucas Pepys,
who luckily happened to be in the neighbourhood at
the time of the accident, bled her on his own responsibility,
and with his own hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<h3>RICHARD MEAD.</h3>


<p>"Dr. Mead," observed Samuel Johnson, "lived
more in the broad sunshine of life than almost any
man."</p>

<p>Unquestionably the lot of Richard Mead was an
enviable one. Without any high advantages of birth
or fortune, or aristocratic connection, he achieved
a European popularity; and in the capital of his own
country had a social position that has been surpassed
by no member of his profession. To the sunshine
in which Mead basked, the lexicographer contributed
a few rays; for when James published his Medicinal
Dictionary, the prefatory letter to Mead, affixed to
the work, was composed by Johnson in his most felicitous
style.</p>

<p>"Sir,—That the Medicinal Dictionary is dedicated
to you, is to be imputed only to your reputation for
superior skill in those sciences which I have endeavoured
to explain and to facilitate; and you are, therefore,
to consider the address, if it be agreeable to you,
as one of the rewards of merit; and, if otherwise, as
one of the inconveniences of eminence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>"However you shall receive it, my design cannot
be disappointed; because this public appeal to your
judgment will show that I do not found my hopes
of approbation upon the ignorance of my readers, and
that I fear his censure least whose knowledge is the
most extensive. I am, sir, your most obedient humble
servant,—<span class="smcap">R. James.</span>"</p>

<p>But the sunshine did not come to Mead. He attracted
it. Polished, courtly, adroit, and of an equable
temper, he seemed pleased with everybody, and
so made everybody pleased with him. Throughout
life he was a Whig—staunch and unswerving, notwithstanding
the charges brought against him by obscure
enemies of being a luke-warm supporter of the
constitutional, and a subservient worshipper of the
monarchical, party. And yet his intimate friends were
of the adverse faction. The overbearing, insolent,
prejudiced Radcliffe forgave him his scholarship and
politics, and did his utmost to advance his interests.</p>

<p>Mead's family was a respectable one in Buckinghamshire.
His father was a theological writer,
and one of the two ministers of Stepney, but was
ejected from his preferment for non-conformity on
the 24th of August, 1662. Fortunately the dispossessed
clerk had a private fortune on which to maintain
his fifteen children, of whom Richard, the eleventh,
was born on the eleventh of August, 1673. The
first years of Richard's life were spent at Stepney,
where the Rev. Matthew Mead continued to minister
to a noncomformist congregation, keeping in house Mr.
John Nesbitt, afterwards a conspicuous nonconformist
minister, as tutor to his children. In 1683 or 1684,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
it being suspected that Mr. Mead was concerned in
certain designs against the government, the worthy
man had to quit his flock and escape from the emissaries
of power to Holland. During the father's residence
abroad, Richard was sent to a classical school
kept in Clerkenwell Close, by the nonconformist,
Thomas Singleton, who had formerly been second
master of Eton. It was under this gentleman's tuition
that the boy acquired a sound and extensive
knowledge of Latin and Greek. In 1690 he went to
Utrecht; and after studying there for three years,
proceeded to Leyden, where he studied botany and
physic. His academical studies concluded, he travelled
with David Polhill and Dr. Thomas Pellet, afterwards
President of the College of Physicians, through
Italy, stopping at Florence, Padua, Naples, and
Rome. In the middle of 1696 he returned to London,
with stores of information, refined manners, and
a degree of Doctor of Philosophy and Physic, conferred
on him at Padua, on the sixteenth of August,
1695. Settling at Stepney, and uniting himself closely
with the nonconformists, he commenced the practice
of his profession, in which he rapidly advanced
to success. On the ninth of May, 1703, before he was
thirty years of age, he was chosen physician of St.
Thomas's Hospital, in Southwark. On obtaining this
preferment he took a house in Crutched Friars, and
year by year increased the sphere of his operations.
In 1711 he moved to Austin Friars, to the house just
vacated by the death of Dr. Howe. The consequences
of this step taught him the value, to a rising doctor,
of a house with a good reputation. Many of Howe's
patients had got into a habit of coming to the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
as much as to the physician, and Mead was only too
glad to feel their pulses and flatter them into good
humour, sound health, and the laudable custom of
paying double fees. He was appointed Lecturer on
Anatomy to the Company of Barbers and Surgeons.</p>

<p>He kept himself well before the public, as an author,
with his "Mechanical Account of Poisons," published
in 1702; and his treatise (1704), "De Imperio
Solis et Lunæ in Corpora humana, et Morbis inde
oriundis." He became a member of the Royal Society;
and, in 1707, he received his M.D. diploma
from Oxford, and his admission to the fellowship of
the College of Physicians.</p>

<p>It has already been stated how Radcliffe engaged
to introduce Mead to his patients. When Queen
Anne was on her death-bed, the young physician was
of importance enough to be summoned to the couch
of dying royalty. The physicians who surrounded
the expiring queen were afraid to say what they all
knew. The Jacobites wanted to gain time, to push
off the announcement of the queen's state to the last
possible moment, so that the Hanoverians should
not be able to take steps for quietly securing the succession
which they desired. Mead, however, was too
earnest a Whig to sacrifice what he believed to be the
true interests of the country to any considerations of
the private advantage that might be derived by currying
favour with the Tory magnates, who, hovering
about the Court, were debating how they could best
make their game. Possibly his hopes emboldened him
to speak the truth. Anyhow, he declared, on his first
visit, that the queen would not live an hour. Charles
Ford, writing to Swift, said, "This morning when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
I went there before nine, they told me she was just
expiring. That account continued above three hours,
and a report was carried to town that she was actually
dead. She was not prayed for even in her own chapel
at St. James's; and, <i>what is more infamous (!)</i>
stocks arose three <i>per cent.</i> upon it in the city. Before
I came away, she had recovered a warmth in
her breast and one of her arms; and all the doctors
agreed she would, in all probability, hold out till to-morrow—<i>except
Mead, who pronounced, several hours
before, she could not live two minutes, and seems uneasy
it did not happen so</i>." This was the tone universally
adopted by the Jacobites. According to them,
poor Queen Anne had hard measure dealt out to her
by her physicians;—the Tory Radcliffe negatively
murdered her by not saving her; the Whig Mead earnestly
desired her death. Certainly the Jacobites
had no reason to speak well of Mead, for the ready
courage with which he stated the queen's demise to
be at hand gave a disastrous blow to their case, and
did much to seat George I. quietly on the throne.
Miss Strickland observes, "It has always been considered
that the prompt boldness of this political physician
(<i>i. e.</i> Mead) occasioned the peaceable proclamation
of George I. The queen's demise in one hour
was confidently predicted by her Whig doctor. He
was often taunted afterwards with the chagrin his
countenance expressed when the royal patient, on
being again blooded, recovered her speech and
senses."</p>

<p>On the death of Radcliffe, the best part of his empire
descended to Mead, who, having already reaped
the benefit of occupying the nest which Howe vacated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
at the summons of death, wisely resolved to
take possession of Radcliffe's vacated mansion in
Bloomsbury Square. This removal from Austin
Friars to the more fashionable quarter of town was
effected without delay. Indeed, Radcliffe was not
buried when Mead entered his house. As his practice
lay now more in the West than the East end of town,
the prosperous physician resigned his appointment
at St. Thomas's, and, receiving the thanks of the grand
committee for his services, was presented with the
staff of a governor of the charity. Radcliffe's practice
and house were not the only possessions of that
sagacious practitioner which Mead contrived to acquire.
Into his hands also passed the doctor's gold-headed
cane of office. This wand became the property
successively of Radcliffe, Askew, Pitcairn, and
Baillie, the arms of all which celebrated physicians
are engraved on its head. On the death of Dr. Baillie,
Mrs. Baillie presented the cane, as an interesting professional
relic, to the College of Physicians, in the library
of which august and learned body it is now preserved.
Some years since the late respected Dr. Macmichael
made the adventures of this stick the subject
of an agreeable little book, which was published under
the title of "The Gold-Headed Cane."</p>

<p>The largest income Mead ever made in one year
was £7000. For several years he received between
£5000 and £6000 per annum. When the great depreciation
of the currency is taken into account, one
may affirm, with little fear of contradiction, that no
living physician is at the present time earning as
much. Mead, however, made his income without any
avaricious or stingy practices. In every respect he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
displayed that generosity which has for generations
been the glorious distinction of his profession. At
home his fee was a guinea. When he visited a patient
of good rank and condition, in consultation or
otherwise, he expected to have two guineas, or even
more. But to the apothecaries who waited on him
at his coffee-houses, he charged (like Radcliffe) only
half-a-guinea for prescriptions, written without seeing
the patient. His evening coffee-house was Batson's,
frequented by the profession even down to Sir
William Blizard; and in the forenoons he received
apothecaries at Tom's, near Covent Garden. In
Mead's time the clergy, as a body, were unable to pay
the demands which professional etiquette would have
required the physician to make on them if he had
any. It is still the humane custom of physicians and
eminent surgeons not to accept fees from curates,
half-pay officers in the army and navy, and men of
letters; and no one has more reason than the writer
of these pages to feel grateful for the delicacy with
which they act on this rule, and the benevolent zeal
with which they seem anxious to drown the sense of
obligation (which a gratuitous patient necessarily experiences)
in increased attention and kindness, as if
their good deeds were a peculiar source of pleasure
to themselves.</p>

<p>But in the last century the beneficed clergy were in
a very different pecuniary condition from that which
they at present enjoy. Till the Tithe Communication
Act passed, the parson (unless he was a sharp man
of business, shrewd and unscrupulous as a horse-jobber,
and ready to have an unintermittent war with
his parishioners) never received anything like what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
he was entitled to of the produce of the land. Often
he did not get half his dues; and even when he did
obtain a fair tithe, his receipts were small compared
with what his successor in the present generation
has from the same source. Agriculture was then in
such a backward state, and land was so ill-cultivated,
that the rector of a large parish of good land was
justly entitled only to a sum that a modern rent-charge
holder would regard with painful surprise if
told that he might take nothing more for his share in
the fruits of the earth. The beneficed clergy were
a comparatively poor body. The curate perhaps was
not in a worse state than he is in now, for the simple
reason that a worse can hardly be. To add to the
impoverished appearance of the clerical profession,
there existed in every capital and country town the
luckless nonconforming clergy, bereft of the emoluments
of their vocation, and often reduced to a condition
scarcely—if at all—removed from begging.
The title of <i>Reverend</i> was still affixed to their names—their
costume was still that of their order—and
by large masses of the people they were regarded with
more reverence and affection than the well-fed Vicars
of Bray, who, with mealy mouths and elastic consciences,
saw only the butter on one side of their
bread, and not the dirt on the other. Archbishop
Sancroft died on his little farm in Suffolk, having
for years subsisted on about fifty pounds a-year.
When such was the fate of an Archbishop of Canterbury,
the straits to which the ejected vicars or disabled
curates were brought can be imagined—but
scarcely described. In the great towns these unfortunate
gentlemen swarmed, gaining a wretched subsistence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
as ushers in schools, tutors, secretaries—not
unfrequently as domestic servants.</p>

<p>In such a condition of the established church, the
rule of never taking money from "the cloth" was
almost invariably observed by the members of the
medical profession.</p>

<p>Mead once—and only once—departed from this
rule. Mr. Robert Leake, a fellow of St. John's College,
Cambridge, called on the doctor and sought his
advice. The patient's ill-health had been in a great
degree effected by doctoring himself—that is, exhibiting,
according to his own notions of medical practice,
some of Dr. Cheyne's prescriptions.</p>

<p>"Do as I tell you," said Mead, "and I'll set you up
again."</p>

<p>For a time Leake cheerfully obeyed; but soon—although
his case was progressing most favourably—he
had the bad taste to suggest that a recurrence to some
of Cheyne's prescriptions would be advisable. Mead,
of course, was not pleased with such folly, but continued
his attendance till his patient's health was restored.
Leake then went through the form of asking
to what amount he was in the physician's debt.</p>

<p>"Sir," answered Mead, "I have never yet, in the
whole course of my practice, taken or demanded the
least fee from any clergyman; but, since you have
been pleased, contrary to what I have met with in any
other gentleman of your profession, to prescribe to me
rather than follow my prescriptions, when you had
committed the care of your recovery to my skill and
trust, you must not take it amiss, nor will, I hope,
think it unfair, if I demand ten guineas of you."</p>

<p>With much reluctance, and a wry face, Leake paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the money, but the doctor subsequently returned him
more than half of it.</p>

<p>Of course Mead did not gain the prize of his profession
without a few rough contests with competitors
in the race of honour. Woodward, the Professor of
Physic at the Gresham College, attacked him with
bitterness in his "State of Physic and Diseases," and
made himself even more obnoxious in his personal demeanour
to him in public. Some insult offered to him
by Woodward so infuriated Mead, that the latter drew
his sword and ordered his adversary to defend himself.
The duel terminated in Mead's favour, as far
as martial prowess was concerned, for he disarmed
Woodward and ordered him to beg for his life.</p>

<p>"Never, till I am your patient," answered Woodward,
happily.</p>

<p>The memory of this Æsculapian battle is preserved
in an engraving in Ward's "Lives of the Gresham
Professors." The picture is a view of Gresham Street
College, with a gateway entering from Broad Street,
marked 25, within which Woodward is represented
as kneeling and submissively yielding his sword to
Mead. Ward was one of Mead's warmest friends,
and certainly on this occasion displayed his friendship
in a very graceful and effective manner.</p>

<p>The doctor would gladly have never had to deal
with a more dangerous antagonist than Woodward;
but the time came when he had to run for safety, and
that too from a woman. He was in attendance by the
bed-side of the Duke of Marlborough, who was suffering
from indisposition, when her Grace—the celebrated
Sarah—flew into a violent rage at some remark
which the physician had dared to make. She even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
threatened him with personal chastisement, and was
proceeding to carry out her menaces, when Mead,
recognizing the peril of his position, turned and
fled from the room. The duchess ran after him, and,
pursuing him down the grand staircase, vowed she
would pull off his wig, and dash it in his face. The
doctor luckily was a better runner than her Grace,
and escaped.</p>

<p>Envy is the shadow of success, and detraction is
the echo of its voice. A host of pamphleteers, with
just courage enough to print lies, to which they had
not the spirit to affix their obscure names, hissed
their malignity at the fortunate doctor. The members
of the Faculty, accustomed though they are to the
jealousies and animosities which are important undercurrents
in every fraternity, would in these days
scarcely credit the accounts which could be given of
the coarseness and baseness of the anonymous rascals
who lampooned Mead. It is painful to know that
some of the worst offenders were themselves physicians.
In 1722, appeared "The Art of getting into
Practice in Physick, here at present in London. In
a letter to that very ingenious and most learned Physician
(Lately come to Town), Dr Timothy Vanbustle,
M.D.—A.B.C.," the writer of this satire attributes
to the dead Radcliffe the practices to which
Hannes was accused of having resorted. "Thus the
famous R——fe, 'tis said, on his first arrival, had
half the porters in town employed to call for him at
all the coffee-houses and public places, so that his
name might be known." The sting of the publication,
the authorship of which by a strange error has
been attributed <i>to</i> Mead, is throughout directed <i>at</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
him. It is more than suggested that he, to creep up
into practice, had associated in early life with "women,
midwives, nurses, and apothecaries," and that he
had interested motives for being very gentle "in taking
fees of the clergy, of whatsoever sect or opinion."
Here is a stab that the reader of the foregoing pages
can appreciate: "As to <i>Nostrums</i>, I cannot much
encourage you to trade in these if you would propose
to get universal business; for though they may serve
to make you known at first, particularly in such a
way, yet it will not promote general business, but on
the contrary. <i>I rather therefore would advise you
to court, flatter, and chime in with the chief in Play,
and luckily a noted practitioner should drop, do you
be as sure and ready to get into his house as he is into
his coffin.</i>"</p>

<p>More scandal of this sort may be found in "An
account of a Strange and Wonderful Dream. Dedicated
to Doctor M——d," published 1719. It is insinuated
in the dream that his Latin writings were not
his own composition. The troubles of his domestic
life are dragged before the public. "It unluckily
happen'd that, just as Mulso discovered his wife's
intrigues, his effects were seized on by his creditors,
his chariot and horses were sold, and he himself reduced
to the state of a foot-quack. In this condition
he had continued to this day, had he not been retrieved
from poverty and contempt by the recommendation
of a physician of great note. Upon this he
spruced up, looked gay, roll'd about in a chariot. At
this time he fell ill of the <i>scribendi cacoethes</i>, and, by
the help of two mathematicians and an usher, was
delivered of a book in a learned language."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>Mead did not long occupy Radcliffe's house in
Bloomsbury Square. In 1719 he moved to the imposing
residence in Ormond Street, to which in 1732 he
added a gallery for the accommodation of his library
and museum.</p>

<p>Of Mead's various contributions to medical literature
it is of course not the province of this work to
speak critically. The <i>Medica Sacra</i> is a literary curiosity,
and so is the doctor's paper published in 1735,
in which he recommends a compound of pepper and
<i>lichen cinereus terrestris</i> as a specific against the bite
of a mad dog. Dampier, the traveller, used this lichen
for the same purpose. The reader need not be reminded
of the popularity attained by this antidote,
dividing the public favour, as it did, with Dr.
James's <i>Turpeth Mineral</i>, and the <i>Musk</i> and <i>Cinnabar</i>.</p>

<p>Mead was married twice. His first wife was Ruth
Marsh, the daughter of a pious London tradesman.
She died in 1719, twenty years after her marriage,
leaving behind her four children—three daughters,
who all married well, and one son, William Mead.
If any reliance is to be placed on the statements of
the lampoon writers, the doctor was by no means fortunate
in this union. He married, however, a second
time—taking for his bride, when he was more than
fifty years old, Anne, the daughter of Sir Rowland
Alston, of Odell, a Bedfordshire baronet.</p>

<p>One of the pleasant episodes in Mead's life is his
conduct towards his dear friend and political antagonist,
Freind—the Jacobite physician, and Member
of Parliament for Launceston. On suspicion of
being concerned in the Atterbury plot, Freind was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
committed to the Tower. During his confinement,
that lasted some months, he employed himself calmly
on the composition of a Latin letter, "On certain
kinds of Small-Pox," and the "History of Physic,
from the time of Galen to the Commencement of the
Sixteenth Century." Mead busied himself to obtain
his friend's release; and, being called to attend Sir
Robert Walpole, pleaded so forcibly for the prisoner,
that the minister allowed him to be discharged on
bail—his sureties being Dr. Mead, Dr. Hulse, Dr.
Levet, and Dr. Hale. To celebrate the termination of
Freind's captivity, Mead called together on a sudden
a large party in Ormond Street, composed of men of
all shades of opinion. Just as Freind was about to
take his leave for his own residence in Albemarle
Street, accompanied by Arbuthnot, who resided in
Cork Street, Burlington Gardens, Mead took him
aside into a private room, and presented him with
a case containing the fees he had received from the
Tory doctor's patients during his imprisonment.
They amounted to no less than five thousand guineas.</p>

<p>Mead's style of living was very liberal. From the
outset to the close of his career he was the companion
of men whom it was an honour to treat hospitably.
He was the friend of Pope, Newton, and Bentley. His
doors were always open to every visitor who came
from a foreign country to these shores, with any claim
whatever on the goodwill of society. To be at the
same time a patron of the arts, and a liberal entertainer
of many guests, demands no ordinary expenditure.
Mead died comparatively poor. The sale of his
library, pictures, statues, and curiosities, realized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
about £16,000, and he had other property amounting
to about £35,000; but, after the payment of his debts,
not more than £20,000 remained to be divided amongst
his four children. His only son, however, was amply
provided for, having entered into the possession of
£30,000 under will of Dr. Mead's unmarried brother
Samuel, an eminent barrister, and a Commissioner of
the Customs.</p>

<p>Fortunate beyond fortunate men, Mead had the
great misfortune of living too long. His sight failed,
and his powers underwent that gradual decay which
is the saddest of all possible conclusions to a vigorous
and dignified existence. Stories might be ferreted
up of the indignities to which he submitted at the
hands of a domineering valet. Long, however, before
he sunk into second childhood, he excited the ridicule
of the town by his vanity, and absurd pretensions to
be a lady-killer. The extravagances of his amorous
senility were whispered about; and, eventually, some
hateful fellow seized hold of the unpleasant rumours,
and published them in a scandalous novelette, called
"The Cornutor of Seventy-five; being a genuine narrative
of the Life, Adventures, and Amours of <i>Don
Ricardo Honeywater</i>, Fellow of the Royal College of
Physicians at Madrid, Salamanca, and Toledo, and
President of the Academy of Sciences in Lapland;
containing, amongst other most diverting particulars,
his intrigue with Donna Maria W——s, of Via Vinculosa—<i>anglice</i>,
Fetter Lane—in the city of Madrid.
Written, originally, in Spanish, by the Author of Don
Quixot, and translated into English by a Graduate of
the College of Mecca, in Arabia." The "Puella fabri,"
as Greenfield designates the damsel who warmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the doctor's aged heart, was the daughter of a blacksmith
in Fetter Lane; and to please her, Mead—long
past threescore years and ten—went to Paris,
and learnt dancing, under Dupré, giving as an excuse
that his health needed active muscular exercise.</p>

<p>Dr. Mead died on February 16, 1754, in his eighty-first
year. He was buried in the Temple Church, by
the side of his brother Samuel. His memory has
been honoured with busts and inscriptions—in Westminster
Abbey, and the College of Physicians.</p>

<p>Mead was not the first of his name to enter the
medical profession. William George Meade was an
eminent physician at Tunbridge Wells; and dying
there on the 4th of November, 1652, was buried at
Ware, in Hertfordshire. This gentleman left £5 a-year
for ever to the poor; but he is more remarkable
for longevity than generosity. He died at the extraordinary
age of 148 years and nine months. This
is one of the most astonishing instances of longevity
on record. Old Parr, dying at 152 years of age, exceeded
it only by 4 years. The celebrated Countess
Desmond was some years more than 140 at the time
of her death. Henry Read, minister of Hardwicke,
Co. Northampton, numbered only 132 years; and the
Lancashire woman (the <i>Cricket of the Hedge</i>) did
not outlive the 141st year. But all these ages become
insignificant when put by the side of the 169 years
to which Henry Jenkins protracted his earthly sojourn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<h3>IMAGINATION AS A REMEDIAL POWER.</h3>


<p>Astrology, alchemy, the once general belief in the
healing effects of the royal touch, the use of charms
and amulets, and mesmerism, are only various exhibitions
of one superstition, having for their essence the
same little grain of truth, and for their outward expression
different forms of error. Disconnected as
they appear at first sight, a brief examination discovers
the common features which prove them to be
of one family. By turns they have—each of them—given
humiliating evidence of the irrational extravagances
that reasoning creatures are capable of committing;
and each of them, also, has conferred some
benefits on mankind. The gibberish of Geber, and
the alchemists who preceded and followed him, led to
the study of chemistry, the utility and importance of
which science we have only begun rightly to appreciate;
and a curiosity about the foolishness of astrology
led Sir Isaac Newton to his astronomical inquiries.
Lord Bacon says—"The sons of chemistry, while they
are busy seeking the hidden gold—whether real or
not—have by turning over and trying, brought much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
profit and convenience to mankind." And if the delusions
of talismans, amulets, and charms, and the impostures
of Mesmer, have had no greater consequences,
they have at least afforded, to the observant and reflective,
much valuable instruction with regard to the
constitution of the human mind.</p>

<p>In the history of these superstitions we have to
consider the universal faith which men in all ages
have entertained in planetary influence, and which,
so long as day and night, and the moon and tides endure,
few will be found so ignorant or so insensible as
to question. The grand end of alchemy was to transmute
the base metals into gold; and it proposed to
achieve this by obtaining possession of the different
fires transmitted by the heavenly bodies to our planet,
and subjecting, according to a mysterious system, the
comparatively worthless substances of the mineral
world to the forces of these fires.</p>

<p>"Now," says Paracelsus, in his "Secrets of Alchemy,"
"we come to speake of a manifold spirit or
fire, which is the cause of variety and diversity of
creatures, so that there cannot one be found right like
another, and the same in every part; as it may be
seen in metals, of which there is none which hath another
like itself; the <i>Sun</i> produceth his gold; the
<i>Moon</i> produceth another metal far different, to wit,
silver; <i>Mars</i> another, that is to say, iron; <i>Jupiter</i> produceth
another kind of metal to wit, tin; <i>Venus</i> another,
which is copper; and <i>Saturn</i> another kind, that
is to say, lead: so that they are all unlike, and several
one from another; the same appeareth to be as well
amongst men as all other creatures, the cause whereof
is the multiplicity of fire.... Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
there is no great mixture of the elements, the Sun
bringeth forth; where it is a little more thick, the
Moon; where more gross, Venus; and thus, according
to the diversity of mixtures, are produced divers metals;
so that no metal appeared in the same mine like
another."</p>

<p>This, which is an extract from Turner's translation
of Paracelsus's "Secrets of Alchemy" (published in
1655), may be taken as a fair sample of the jargon of
alchemy.</p>

<p>The same faith in planetary influence was the
grand feature of astrology, which regarded all natural
phenomena as the effects of the stars acting upon
the earth. Diseases of all kinds were referable to
the heavenly bodies; and so, also, were the properties
of those herbs or other objects which were believed
in as remedial agents. In ancient medicine, pharmacy
was at one period only the application of the
dreams of astrology to the vegetable world. The herb
which put an ague or madness to flight, did so by reason
of a mystic power imparted to it by a particular
constellation, the outward signs of which quality were
to be found in its colour or aspect. Indeed, it was not
enough that "a simple," impregnated with curative
power by heavenly beams, should be culled; but it had
to be culled at a particular period of the year, at a
particular day of the month, even at a particular
hour, when the irradiating source of its efficacy was
supposed to be affecting it with a peculiar force; and,
moreover, it had to be removed from the ground or
the stem on which it grew with a particular instrument
or gesture of the body—a disregard of which
forms would have obviated the kindly influence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
the particular star, without whose benignant aid the
physician and the drug were alike powerless.</p>

<p>Medical practitioners smile now at the mention of
these absurdities. But many of them are ignorant
that they, in their daily practice, help to perpetuate
the observance of one of these ridiculed forms. The
sign which every member of the Faculty puts before
his prescriptions, and which is very generally interpreted
as an abbreviation for <i>Recipe</i>, is but the astrological
symbol of Jupiter.</p>

<p>It was on this principle that a belief became prevalent
that certain objects, either of natural formation
or constructed by the instruments of art, had the power
of counteracting noxious agents. An intimate connection
was supposed to exist between the form or
colour of an external substance and the use to which
it ought to be put. Red objects had a mysterious influence
on inflammatory diseases; and yellow ones had
a similar power on those who were discoloured with
jaundice. Edward II.'s physician, John of Gaddesden,
informs us, "When the son of the renowned
King of England lay sick of the small-pox, I took
care that everything round the bed should be of a red
colour, which succeeded so completely that the Prince
was restored to perfect health without a vestige of a
pustule remaining." Even as late as 1765, this was
put in practice to the Emperor Francis I. The earliest
talismans were natural objects, with a more or
less striking external character, imagined to have been
impressed upon them by the planets of whose influence
they were especially susceptible, and of whose
virtues they were beyond all other substances the recipients.
The amulet (which differs little from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
talisman, save in that it must be worn suspended upon
the person it is to protect, whereas the talisman might
be kept by its fortunate possessor locked up in his
treasure-house) had a like origin.</p>

<p>But when once a superstitious regard was paid to
the external marks of a natural object, it was a short
and easy step to produce the semblances of the revered
characters by an artificial process, and then bestow
on them the reverential feelings which had previously
been directed to their originals. The ordinary
course taken by a superstition in its degradation
is one where its first sentiment becomes lost to sight,
and its form is dogmatically insisted on. It was so
in that phase of feticism which consisted in the blind
reliance put on artificial talismans and amulets. The
original significance of the talisman—the truth which
was embodied in it as the emblem of the unseen powers
that had produced it, in accordance with natural
operations—was forgotten. The rows of lines and
scratches, and the variegations of its colour, were only
thought of; and the cunning of man—ever ready to
make a god for himself—was exerted to improve upon
them. In the multitude of new devices came inscriptions
of mystic numbers, strange signs, agglomerations
of figures, and scraps from sacred rituals—Abraxas
and Abracadabra, and the Fi-fo-fum nonsense
of the later charms.</p>

<p>Creatures that were capable of detecting the influence
of the planetary system on that portion of Nature
which is unquestionably affected by it, and of
imagining its presence in inanimate objects, which,
to use cautious language, have never been proved by
science to be sensible of such a power, of course magnified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
its consequences in all that related to the human
intellect and character. The instant in which a man
entered the world was regarded as the one when he was
most susceptible. Indeed, a babe was looked upon
as a piece of warm and pliant wax: and the particular
planet which was in the ascendant when the nurse
placed the new child of Adam amongst the people of
earth stamped upon it a distinctive charactery. To
be born under a particular star was then an expression
that meant something. On the nature of the
star it depended whether homunculus, squealing out
its first agonies, was to be morose or gentle, patient
or choleric, lively or saturnine, amorous or vindictive—a
warrior or a poet—a dreamer or a man of action.</p>

<p>Laughing at the refinements of absurdity at which
astrology had arrived in his day, the author of "Hudibras"
says:—</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>Involved in this view of the universe was the doctrine
that some exceptional individuals were born far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
superior to the mass of their fellow-creatures. Absurd
as astrology was, still, its postulates having once
been granted, the logic was unassailable which argued
that those few on whose birth lucky stars had shone
benignantly, had a destiny and an organization distinct
from those of ordinary mortals. The dicta of
modern liberalism, and the Transatlantic dogma that
"all men are by nature born equal," would have appeared
to an orthodox believer in this planetary religion
nothing better than the ravings of madness or
impiety. Monarchs of men, whatever lowly station
they at first occupied in life, were exalted above others
because they possessed a distinctive excellence
imparted to them at the hour of birth by the silent
rulers of the night. It was useless to strive against
such authority. To contend with it would have been
to wrestle with the Almighty—ever present in his
peculiarly favoured creatures.</p>

<p>Rulers being such, it was but natural for their servile
worshippers to believe them capable of imparting
to others, by a glance of the eye or a touch of the
hand, an infinitesimal portion of the virtue that dwelt
within them. To be favoured with their smiles was
to bask in sunshine amid perfumes. To be visited
with their frowns was to be chilled to the marrow,
and feel the hail come down like keen arrows from
an angry sky. To be touched by their robes was to
receive new vigour. Hence came credence in the
miraculous power of the imposition of royal, or otherwise
sacred hands. Pyrrhus and Vespasian cured
maladies by the touch of their fingers; and, long before
and after them, earthly potentates and spiritual
directors had, both in the East and the West, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
prove their title to authority by displaying the same
faculty.</p>

<p>In our own country more than in any other region
of Christendom this superstition found supporters.
From Edward the Confessor down to Queen Anne,
who laid her healing hands on Samuel Johnson, it
flourished; and it was a rash man who, trusting to
the blind guidance of human reason dared to question
that manifestation of the divinity which encircles
kingship. Doubtless the gift of money made to each
person who was touched did not tend to bring the
cure into dis-esteem. It can be easily credited that,
out of the multitude who flocked to the presence of
Elizabeth and the Stuart kings for the benefit of their
miraculous manipulations, there were many shrewd
vagabonds who had more faith in the coin than in
the touch bestowed upon them. The majority, however,
it cannot be doubted, were as sincere victims
of delusion as those who, at the close of the last century,
believed in the efficacy of metallic tractors, and
those who now unconsciously expose their intellectual
infirmity as advocates of electro-biology and spirit-rapping.
The populace, as a body, unhesitatingly
believed that their sovereigns possessed this faculty
as the anointed of the Lord. A story is told of a
Papist, who, much to his astonishment, was cured of
the king's evil by Elizabeth, after her final rupture
with the court of Rome.</p>

<p>"Now I perceive," cried the man, "by plain experience
that the excommunication against the Queen
is of no effect, since God hath blessed her with such a
gift."</p>

<p>Nor would it be wise to suppose that none were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
benefited by the treatment. The eagerness with which
the vulgar crowd to a sight, and the intense excitement
with which London mobs witness a royal procession
to the houses of Parliament, or a Lord Mayor's
pageant on its way from the City to Westminster,
may afford us some idea of the inspiriting sensations
experienced by a troop of wretches taken from their
kennels to Whitehall, and brought into personal contact
with their sovereign—their ideal of grandeur!
Such a trip was a stimulus to the nervous system,
compared with which the shock of a galvanic battery
would have been but the tickling of a feather. And,
over and above this, was the influence of imagination,
which in many ways may become an agent for restoring
the tone of the nervous system, and so enabling
Nature to overcome the obstacles of her healthy
action.</p>

<p>Montaigne admirably treated this subject in his
essay, "Of the Force of Imagination"; and his anecdote
of the happy results derived by an unfortunate
nobleman from the use of a flat gold plate, graven
with celestial figures, must have occurred to many of
his readers who have witnessed the beneficial effects
which are frequently produced by the practices of
quackery.</p>

<p>"These apes' tricks," says Montaigne, "are the
main cause of the effect, our fancy being so far seduced
as to believe that such strange and uncouth formalities
must of necessity proceed from some abstruse
science. Their very inanity gives them reverence and
weight."</p>

<p>And old Burton, touching, in his "Anatomy of Melancholy,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
on the power of imagination, says,
quaintly:—</p>

<p>"How can otherwise blear eyes in one man cause
the like affection in another? Why doth one man's
yawning make another man yawn? Why do witches
and old women fascinate and bewitch children; but,
as Wierus, Paracelsus, Cardan, Migaldus, Valleriola,
Cæsar Vanninus, Campanella, and many philosophers
think, the forcible imagination of one party moves
and alters the spirits of the other. Nay more, they
cause and cure, not only diseases, maladies, and several
infirmities by this means, as 'Avicenna de Anim.
1. 4, sect. 4,' supposeth in parties remote, but move
bodies from their places, cause thunder, lightning,
tempests; which opinion Alkindus, Paracelsus, and
some others approve of."</p>

<p>In this passage Burton touches not only on the effects
of the imagination, but also on the impression
which the nervous energy of one person may create
upon the nervous sensibility of another. That such
an impression can be produced, no one can question
who observes the conduct of men in their ordinary
relations to each other. By whatever term we christen
it—endeavouring to define either the cause or its effect—we
all concur in admitting that decision of character,
earnestness of manner, enthusiasm, a commanding
aspect, a piercing eye, or a strong will, exercise
a manifest control over common natures, whether
they be acting separately or in masses.</p>

<p>Of the men who, without learning, or an ennobling
passion for truth, or a high purpose of any kind,
have, unaided by physical force, commanded the attention
and directed the actions of large numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
their fellow creatures, Mesmer is perhaps the most
remarkable in modern history. But we will not speak
of him till we have paid a few minutes' attention to
one of his predecessors.</p>

<p>The most notable forerunner of Mesmer in this
country was Valentine Greatrakes, who, in Charles
the Second's reign, performed "severall marvaillous
cures by the stroaking of the hands." He was a gentleman
of condition, and, at first, the dupe of his own
imagination rather than a deliberate charlatan. He
was born on the 14th of February, 1628, on his
father's estate of Affane, in the County of Waterford,
and was, on both sides, of more than merely respectable
extraction, his father being a gentleman of good
repute and property, and his mother being a daughter
of Sir Edward Harris, Knt, a Justice of the King's
Bench in Ireland. The first years of his school-life
were passed in the once famous Academy of Lismore;
but when he had arrived at thirteen years of age his
mother (who had become a widow), on the outbreak
of the rebellion, fled with him and his little brothers
and sisters to England, where the fugitive family
were hospitably entertained by Mr. Edmund Harris,
a gentleman of considerable property, and one of the
justice's sons. After concluding his education in the
family of one John Daniel Getseus, a High-German
minister of Stock Gabriel, in the County of Devon,
Valentine returned to Ireland, then distracted with
tumult and armed rebellion; and, by prudently joining
the victorious side, re-entered on the possession of
his father's estate of Affane. He served for six years
in Cromwell's forces (from 1650 to 1656) as a lieutenant
of the Munster Cavalry, under the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of the Earl of Orrery. Valentine's commission was
in the earl's regiment; and, from the time of entering
the army till the close of his career is lost sight of, he
seems to have enjoyed the patronage and friendship
of that nobleman's family.</p>

<p>When the Munster horse was disbanded in 1656,
Valentine retired to Affane, and for a period occupied
himself as an active and influential country gentleman.
He was made Clerk of the Peace for the County
of Cork, a Register for Transplantation, and a Justice
of the Peace. In the performance of the onerous
duties which, in the then disturbed state of Ireland,
these offices brought upon him, he gained deserved
popularity and universal esteem. He was a frank
and commanding personage, of pleasant manners, gallant
bearing, fine figure, and singularly handsome
face. With a hearty and musical voice, and a national
stock of high animal spirits, he was the delight of all
festive assemblies, taking his pleasure freely, but
never to excess. Indeed, Valentine was a devout man,
not ashamed, in his own household, and in his bearing
to the outer world, to avow that it was his intention to
serve the Lord. But, though he had all the purity of
Puritanism, there was in him no taint of sectarian
rancour or uncharitableness. When an anonymous
writer aspersed his reputation, he responded—and no
one could gainsay his words—with regard to his public
career:—"I studied so to acquit myself before God
and man in singleness and integrity of heart, that, to
the comfort of my soul, and praise of God that
directed me, I can with confidence say I never took
bribe nor reward from any man, though I had many
and great ones before me (when I was Register for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Transplantation); nor did I ever connive at or suffer
a malefactor to go unpunished, if the person were
guilty of any notorious crime (when I had power),
nor did I ever take the fee belonging to my office, if I
found the person were injured, or in want; nor did I
ever commit any one for his judgment and conscience
barely, so it led him not to do anything to the disturbance
of the civil peace of the nation; nor did I take
anything for my fee when he was discharged—for I
bless God he has taken away a persecuting spirit from
me, who would persuade all men to be Protestants,
those principles being most consonant to Truth and
the Word of God, in my judgment, and that profession
which I have ever been of, and still am....
Yet (though there were orders from the power that
then was, to all Justices of the Peace, for Transplanting
all Papists that would not go to church), I never
molested any one that was known or esteemed to be
innocent, but suffered them to continue in the English
quarters, and that without prejudice. So that I can
truly say, I never injured any man for his conscience,
conceiving that ought to be informed and not enforced."</p>

<p>On the Restoration, Valentine Greatrakes lost his
offices, and was reduced to the position of a mere private
gentleman. His estate at Affane was a small one;
but he laboured on it with good results, introducing
into his neighbourhood a more scientific system of
agriculture than had previously been known there,
and giving an unprecedented quantity of employment
to the poor. Perhaps he missed the excitement of
public business, and his energies, deprived of the vent
they had for many years enjoyed, preyed upon his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
sensitive nature. Anyhow, he became the victim of
his imagination, which, acting on a mind that had
been educated in a school of spiritual earnestness and
superstitious introspection, led him into a series of
remarkable hallucinations. He first had fits of pensiveness
and dejection, similar to those which tormented
Cromwell ere his genius found for itself a
more fit field of display than the management of a
brewery and a few acres of marsh-land. Ere long he
had an impulse, or a strange persuasion in his own
mind (of which he was not able to give any rational
account to another), which did very frequently suggest
to him that there was bestowed on him the gift of
curing the King's Evil, which for the extraordinariness
of it, he thought fit to conceal for some time, but,
at length communicated to his wife, and told her,
"That he did verily believe that God had given him
the blessing of curing the King's Evil; for, whether
he were in private or publick, sleeping or waking, still
he had the same impulse; but her reply was to him,
that she conceived this was a strange imagination."
Such is his statement.</p>

<p>Patients either afflicted with King's Evil, or presumed
to be so, were in due course brought before him;
and, on his touching them, they recovered. It may be
here remarked that in the days when the Royal Touch
was believed in as a cure for scrofula, the distinctions
between strumous and other swellings were by no
means ascertained even by physicians of repute; and
numbers of those who underwent the manipulation of
Anointed Rulers were suffering only from aggravated
boils and common festering sores, from which, as a
matter of course, nature would in the space of a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
weeks have relieved them. Doubtless many of Valentine's
patients were suffering, not under scrofulous
affections, but comparatively innocent tumours; for
his cures were rapid, complete, and numerous. A
second impulse gave him the power of curing ague;
and a third inspiration of celestial aura imparted to
him command, under certain conditions, over all
human diseases. His modes of operation were various.
When an afflicted person was laid before him,
he usually offered up a prayer to God to help him, to
make him the humble instrument of divine mercy.
And invariably when a patient derived benefit from
his treatment, he exhorted him to offer up his thanks
to his Heavenly Father. After the initiatory supplication
the operator passed his hands over the affected
part of the sick person's body, sometimes over the
skin itself and sometimes over the clothes. The manipulations
varied in muscular force from delicate tickling
to violent rubbing, according to the nature of the
evil spirits by which the diseased people were tormented.
Greatrakes's theory of disease was the scriptural
one: the morbific power was a devil, which had
to be expelled from the frame in which it had taken
shelter. Sometimes the demon was exorcised by a few
gentle passes; occasionally it fled at the verbal command
of the physician, or retreated on being gazed at
through the eyes of the mortal it tormented; but frequently
the victory was not gained till the healer
rubbed himself—like the rubber who in our own day
makes such a large income at Brighton—into a red
face and a copious perspiration. Henry Stubbe, a
famous physician in Stratford-upon-Avon, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
"Miraculous Conformist," published in 1666, gives
the following testimony:—</p>

<p>"<i>Proofs that he revives the Ferment of the Blood.</i>—Mr
Bromley's brother, of Upton upon Severne,
after a long quartane Ague, had by a Metastasis of
the Disease such a chilnesse in the habit of the body,
that no clothes could possibly warme him; he wore
upon his head many spiced caps, and tenne pounds
weight of linen on his head. Mr Greatarick stripped
him, and rubbed him all over, and immediately he
sweat, and was hot all over, so that the bath never
heated up as did the hand of Mr Greatarick's; this
was his own expression. But Mr Greatarick causing
him to cast off all that multitude of caps and cloaths,
it was supposed that it frustrated the happy effect,
for he felt the recourse of his disease in some parts
rendered the cure suspicious. But as often as Mr
Greatarick came and rubbed him he would be all
in a flame againe for half-an-hour: the experiment
whereof was frequently practised for five or six dayes
at Ragly."</p>

<p>Greatrakes himself also speaks of his more violent
curative exertions making him very hot. But it was
only occasionally that he had to labour so vehemently.
His eye, the glance of which had a fascinating effect
on people of a nervous organization, and his fantastic
ticklings, usually produced all the results required by
his mode of treatment.</p>

<p>The fame of the healer spread far and wide. Not
only from the most secluded parts of Ireland, but
from civilized England, the lame and blind, the deaf,
dumb, and diseased, made pilgrimages to the Squire
of Affane. His stable, barn, and malt-house were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
crowded with wretches imploring his aid. The demands
upon his time were so very many and great,
that he set apart three days in the week for the reception
of patients; and on those days, from six in the
morning till six in the evening, he ministered to his
wretched clients. He took no fee but gratitude on the
part of those he benefited, and a cheering sense that
he was fulfilling the commands of the founder of his
religion. The Dean of Lismore cited him to appear
before the ecclesiastical court, and render an account
of his proceedings. He went, and on being asked if
he had worked any cures, replied to the court that
they might come to his house and see. The judge
asked if he had a licence to practise from the ordinary
of the diocese; and he replied that he knew of no law
which prohibited any man from doing what good he
could to others. He was, however, commanded by the
court not to lay his hands again on the sick, until he
had obtained the Ordinary's licence to do so. He
obeyed for two days only, and went on again more
earnestly than ever.</p>

<p>Let a charlatan or an enthusiast spread his sails,
the breeze of fashion is always present, and ready to
swell them. The Earl of Orrery took his quondam
lieutenant by the hand, and persuaded him to go over
to England to cure the Viscountess Conway of a violent
headache, which, in spite of the ablest physicians
of England and France, she had suffered from for
many years. Lord Conway sent him an urgent invitation
to do so. He complied, and made his way to
Rugby, in Warwickshire, where he was unable to give
relief to his hostess, but was hospitably entertained
for a month. His inability to benefit Lady Conway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
did not injure his reputation, for he did not profess to
be able to cure every one. An adverse influence—such
as the sins of a patient, or his want of faith—was
enough to counteract the healing power. In the
jargon of modern mesmerism, which <i>practically</i> was
only a revival of Greatrakes's extravagances, the physician
could affect only those who were susceptible.
But though Lady Conway was beyond the reach of his
mysterious agency, the reverse was the case with
others. The gentry and commonalty of Warwickshire
crowded by thousands to him; and he touched, prayed
over, and blessed them, and sent them away rejoicing.
From Rugby he went to Worcester, at the request of
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of that city; and from
Worcester he was carried up to London. Lord Arlington
commanded him to appear at Whitehall, and
mumble in his particular fashion for the amusement
of Charles II. A man who could cure gout by a touch
would have been an acquisition to such a court as then
presided over English manners.</p>

<p>In London he immediately became a star. The
fashion of the West, and the wary opulence of the
East, laid their offerings at his feet. For a time he
ruled from Soho to Wapping. Mr. Justice Godfrey
gave him rooms for the reception of patients in his
mansion in Lincoln's-inn-Fields; and thither flocked
the mob of the indigent and the mob of the wealthy
to pay him homage. Mr. Boyle (the brother of the
Earl of Orrery), Sir William Smith, Dr. Denton, Dr.
Fairclough, Dr. Faber, Sir Nathaniel Hobart, Sir
John Godolphin, Dr. Wilkins, Dr. Whichcot, and Dr.
Cudworth, were amongst his most vehement supporters
of the sterner sex. But the majority of his admirers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
were ladies. The Countess of Devonshire entertained
him in her palace; and Lady Ranelagh frequently
amused the guests at her routs with Mr. Valentine
Greatrakes, who, in the character of <i>the lion</i>
of the season, performed with wondrous results on
the prettiest or most hysterical of the ladies present.
It was held as certain by his intimate friends that the
curative property that came from him was a subtle
aura, effulgent, and of an exquisitely sweet smell, that
could only be termed the divine breath. "God," says
Dr. Henry Stubbe, "had bestowed upon Mr. Greaterick
a peculiar temperament, or composed his body of
some particular ferments, the effluvia whereof, being
introduced sometimes by a light, sometimes by a violent
friction, should restore the temperament of the
debilitated parts, re-invigorate the blood, and dissipate
all heterogeneous ferments out of the bodies of
the diseased by the eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet.
I place the gift of healing in the temperament or composure
of his body, because I see it is necessary that
he touch them. Besides, the Right Honourable the
Lord Conway observed one morning, as he came into
his Lordship's chamber, a smell strangely pleasant,
as if it had been of sundry flowers; and demanding of
his man what sweet water he had brought into the
room, he answered, <i>None</i>; whereupon his Lordship
smelled upon the hand of Mr. Greaterick, and found
the fragrancy to issue thence; and examining his
bosom, he found the like scent there also." Dean
Rust gave similar testimony; and "Sir Amos Meredith,
who had been Mr. Greaterick's bed-fellow," did
the like.</p>

<p>Amongst the certificates of cures performed, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
Greatrakes published, are two to which the name of
Andrew Marvell is affixed, as a spectator of the stroking.
One of them is the following:—</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Mr Nicholson's Certificate.</span></p>

<p>"I, Anthony Nicholson, of Cambridge, Bookseller,

at the bath in Somersetshire, and been at above one
hundred pounds expense to procure ease, or a cure of
these pains; and have found all the means I could be
advised or directed to ineffectual for either, till, by
the advice of Dr Benjamin Whichcot and Dean Rust,
I applyed myself to Mr Greatrake's for help upon
Saturday was sevenight, being the latter end of
March, and who then stroked me; upon which I was
very much worse, and enforced to keep my bed for
five or six days; but then being stroked twice since,
by the blessing of God upon Mr Greatrake's endeavours,
I am perfectly eas'd of all pains, and very
healthy and strong, insomuch as I intend (God willing)
to return home towards Cambridge to-morrow
morning, though I was so weak as to be necessitated to
be brought up in men's arms, on Saturday last about
11 of the clock, to Mr Greatrake's. Attested by me
this tenth day of April, 1666. I had also an hard
swelling in my left arm, whereby I was disabled from
using it; which being taken out by the said Mr Greatrake's,
I am perfectly freed of all pain, and the use
thereof greatly restored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>There were worse features of life in Charles the
Second's London than the popularity of Valentine
Greatrakes; but his triumph was of short duration.
His professions were made the butts of ridicule, to
which his presence of mind and volubility were unable
to respond with effect. It was asserted by his enemies
that his system was only a cloak under which he
offended the delicacy of virtuous women, and roused
the passions of the unchaste. His tone of conversation
was represented as compounded of the blasphemy
of the religious enthusiast and the blasphemy of the
profligate. His boast that he never received a fee for
his remedial services was met by flat contradiction,
and a statement that he received presents to the
amount of £100 at a time from a single individual.
This last accusation was never clearly disposed of;
but it is probable that the reward he sought (if he
looked for any) was restoration, through Court influence,
to the commission of magistrates for his
county, and the lost clerkship of the peace. The tide
of slander was anyhow too strong for him, and he retired
to his native country a less honoured though
perhaps a not less honest man than he left it. Of his
sincerity at the outset of his career as a healer there
can be little doubt.</p>

<p>Valentine Greatrakes did unconsciously what many
years after him Mesmer did by design. He in his remarkable
career illustrated the power which a determined
man may exercise over the will and nervous
life of another.</p>

<p>As soon as the singular properties of the loadstone
were discovered, they were presumed to have a strong
medicinal effect; and in this belief physicians for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
centuries—and indeed almost down to present times—were
in the habit of administering pulverized magnet
in salves, plaisters, pills, and potions. It was not till
the year 1660 that it was for the first time distinctly
recorded in the archives of science, by Dr. Gilbert, of
Colchester, that in a state of pulverization the loadstone
no longer possessed any magnetic powers. But
it was not till some generations after this that medical
practitioners universally recognized the fact that
powder of magnet, externally or internally administered,
was capable of producing no other results than
the presence of any ordinary ferruginous substance
would account for. But long after this error had
been driven from the domains of science, an unreasonable
belief in the power of magnets applied externally
to the body held its ground. In 1779-80, the
Royal Society of Medicine in Paris made numerous
experiments with a view to arrive at a just appreciation
of the influence of magnets on the human system,
and came to the conclusion that they were medicinal
agents of no ordinary efficacy.</p>

<p>Such was the state of medical opinion at the close
of the last century, when Perkins's tractors, which
were supposed to act magnetically, became the fashion.
Mr. Perkins was a citizen of Connecticut, and
certainly his celebrated invention was worthy of the
'cutest people on the 'varsal earth. Barnum's
swindles were modest ventures by comparison. The
entire world, old and new, went tractor-mad. Every
valetudinarian bought the painted nails, composed of
an alloy of various metals (which none but Perkins
could make, and none but Perkins sell), and tickled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
with their sharp ends those parts of his frame which
were regarded as centres of disease.</p>

<p>The phenomena apparently produced by these instruments
were astounding, and misled every observer
of them; until Dr. Haygarth of Bath proved by a
process to which objections was impossible, that they
were referable not to metal points, but to the mental
condition of those who used them. "Robert Thomas,"
says Dr. Haygarth in his interesting work, "aged
forty-three, who had been for some time under the
care of Dr. Lovell, in the Bristol Infirmary, with a
rheumatic affection of the shoulder, which rendered
his arm perfectly useless, was pointed out as a proper
object of trial by Mr. J. W. Dyer, apothecary to the
house. Tuesday, April 19th, having everything in
readiness, I passed through the ward, and, in a way
that he might suspect nothing, questioned him respecting
his complaint. I then told him that I had
an instrument in my pocket which had been very
serviceable to many in his state; and when I had
explained to him how simple it was, he consented to
undergo the operation. In six minutes no other effect
was produced than a warmth upon the skin, and I
feared that this <i>coup d'essai</i> had failed. The next
day, however, he told me that 'he had received so
much benefit that it had enabled him to lift his hand
from his knee, which he had in vain several times attempted
on Monday evening, as the whole ward witnessed.'
The tractors I used being made of lead, I
thought it advisable to lay them aside, lest, being
metallic points, the proof against the fraud might be
less complete. Thus much, however, was proved, that
the patent tractors possessed no specific power independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of simple metals. Two pieces of wood,
properly shaped and painted, were next made use of;
and in order to add solemnity to the farce, Mr. Barton
held in his hand a stop-watch, whilst Mr. Lax minuted
the effects produced. In four minutes the man raised
his hand several inches; and he had lost also the pain
in his shoulder, usually experienced when attempting
to lift anything. He continued to undergo the operation
daily, and with progressive good effect; for on
the twenty-fifth he could touch the mantel-piece. On
the twenty-seventh, in the presence of Dr. Lovell and
Mr. J. P. Noble, two common iron nails, disguised
with sealing-wax, were substituted for the pieces of
mahogany before used. In three minutes he felt
something moving from his arm to his hand, and soon
after he touched the board of rules which hung a foot
above the fire-place. This patient at length so far
recovered that he could carry coals and use his arm
sufficiently to help the nurse; yet, previous to the
use of the spurious tractors, he could no more lift
his hand from his knee than if a hundredweight were
upon it, or a nail driven through it—as he declared in
the presence of several gentlemen, whose names I
shall have frequent occasion to mention. The fame
of this case brought applications in abundance; indeed,
it must be confessed that it was more than sufficient
to act upon weak minds, and induce a belief that
these pieces of wood and iron were endowed with some
peculiar virtues."</p>

<p>The result of Dr. Haygarth's experiments was the
overthrow of Perkins, and the enlightenment of the
public as to the real worth of the celebrated metallic
tractors. In achieving this the worthy physician<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
added some interesting facts to the science of psychology.
But of course his influence upon the
ignorant and foolish persons he illuminated was only
transient. Ere a few short years or even months were
over, they had embraced another delusion—not less
ridiculous, but more pernicious.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>IMAGINATION AND NERVOUS EXCITEMENT. MESMER.</h3>


<p>At a very early date the effects of magnetic influences,
and the ordinary phenomena of nervous excitement,
were the source of much confusion and perplexity
to medical speculators, who, with an unsound
logic that is perhaps more frequent than any other
form of bad reasoning, accounted for what they could
not understand by pointing to what they were only
imperfectly acquainted with. The power of the loadstone
was a mystery; the nervous phenomena produced
by a strong will over a weak one were a mystery:—clearly
the mysterious phenomena were to be
attributed to the mysterious power. In its outset animal
magnetism committed no other error than this.
Its wilder extravagances were all subsequent to this
assumption, that two sets of phenomena, which it has
never yet been proved are nearly allied, were connected,
the one with the other, in the relation of cause
and effect, or as being the offspring of one immediate
and common cause.</p>

<p>To support this theory, Mesmerism called into its
service the old astrological views regarding planetary
influence. But it held also that the subtle fluid, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
transmitted to the animal life of our planet, was capable
of being passed on in greater or less volumes of
quantity and intensity. Nervous energy was only
that subtle fluid which was continually passing and
repassing in impalpable currents between the earth
and the celestial bodies; and when, by reason of the
nervous energy within him, any one exercised control
over another, he was deemed only to have infused
him with some of his own stock of spiritual aura.
Here was a new statement of the old dream which had
charmed the poets and philosophers of buried centuries;
and as it was a view which did not admit of positive
disproof, it was believed by its excited advocates
to be proved.</p>

<p>One of the first British writers on animal magnetism
was William Maxwell, a Scotch physician, who
enunciated his opinions with a boldness and perspicacity
which do him much credit. The first four of his
twelve conclusions are a very good specimen of his
work:—</p>

<p>"<i>Conclusio 1.</i>—Anima non solum in corpore proprio
visibili, sed etiam extra corpus est, nec corpore
organico circumscribitur.</p>

<p>"<i>Conclusio 2.</i>—Anima extra corpus proprium, communiter
sic dictum, operatur.</p>

<p>"<i>Conclusio 3.</i>—Ab omni corpore radii corporales
fluunt, in quibus anima sua præsentia, operatur;
hisque energiam et potentiam operandi largitur. Sunt
vero radii hi non solum corporales, sed et diversarum
partium.</p>

<p>"<i>Conclusio 4.</i>—Radii hi, qui ex animalium corporibus
emittuntur, spiritu vitali gaudent, per quem
animæ mutationes dispensantur."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>The sixty-fifth of the aphorisms with which Maxwell
concludes his book is an amusing one, as giving
the orthodox animal-magnetic view of that condition
of the affections which we term love, and also as illustrating
the connection between astrology and
charms.</p>

<p>"<i>Aphorism 65.</i>—Imaginatione vero producitur
amor, quando imaginatio exaltata unius imaginationi
alterius dominatur, eamque fingit sigillatque; atque
hoc propter miram imaginationis volubilitatem vicissim
fieri potest. Hinc incantationes effectum nanciscuntur,
licet aliqualem forsan in se virtutem possideant,
sine imaginatione tamen hæc virtus propter universalitatem
distribui nequit."</p>

<p>Long before animal magnetism was a stock subject
of conversation at dinner-parties, there was a vague
knowledge of its pretensions floating about society;
and a curiosity to know how far its principles were
reconcilable with facts, animated men of science and
lovers of the marvellous. Had not this been the state
of public feeling, the sensations created by Sir Kenelm
Digby's sympathetic cures, Greatrake's administrations,
Leverett's manual exercises, and Loutherbourg's
manipulations, would not have been so great
and universal.</p>

<p>But the person who turned the credulity of the public
on this point to the best account was Frederick
Anthony Mesmer. This man did not originate a
single idea. He only traded on the old day-dreams
and vagaries of departed ages; and yet he managed to
fix his name upon a science (?), in the origination or
development of which he had no part whatever; and,
by daring charlatanry, he made it a means of grasping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
enormous wealth. Where this man was born is uncertain.
Vienna, Werseburg in Swabia, and Switzerland,
contend for the honour of having given him to
the world. At Vienna he took his M.D. degree, having
given an inaugural dissertation on "The Influence
of the Planets upon the Human Body." His course
of self-delusion began with using magnets as a means
of cure, when applied externally; and he had resolutely
advanced on the road of positive knavery, when,
after his quarrel with his old instructor, Maximilian
Hel, he threw aside the use of steel magnets, and produced,
by the employment of his fingers and eyes,
greater marvels than had ever followed the application
of the loadstone or Perkins's tractors. As his
prosperity and reputation increased, so did his audacity—which
was always laughable, when it did not disgust
by its impiety.</p>

<p>On one occasion, Dr. Egg Von Ellekon asked him
why he ordered his patients to bathe in river, and not
in spring water? "Because," was the answer, "river
water is exposed to the sun's rays." "True," was
the reply, "the water is sometimes warmed by the
sun, but not so much so that you have not sometimes
to warm it still more. Why then should not spring
water be preferable?" Not at all posed, Mesmer answered,
with charming candour, "Dear doctor, the
cause why all the water which is exposed to the rays
of the sun is superior to all other water is because it
is magnetized. I myself magnetized the sun some
twenty years ago."</p>

<p>But a better story of him is told by Madame Campan.
That lady's husband was attacked with pulmonary
inflammation. Mesmer was sent for, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
found himself called upon to stem a violent malady,
not to gull the frivolous Parisians, who were then
raving about the marvels of the new system. He felt
his patient's pulse, made certain inquiries, and then,
turning to Madame Campan, gravely assured her that
the only way to restore her husband to health was to
lay in his bed, by his side one of three things—a
young woman of brown complexion, a black hen, or an
old bottle. "Sir," replied Madame Campan, "if the
choice be a matter of indifference, pray try the empty
bottle." The bottle was tried, but Mons. Campan
grew worse. Madame Campan left the room, alarmed
and anxious, and, during her absence, Mesmer bled
and blistered his patient. This latter treatment was
more efficacious. But imagine Madame Campan's
astonishment, when on her husband's recovery, Mesmer
asked for and obtained from him a written certificate
that he had been cured by Mesmerism!</p>

<p>It is instructive to reflect that the Paris which made
for a short day Mesmer its idol, was not far distant
from the Paris of the Reign of Terror. In one year
the man received 400,000 francs in fees; and positively
the French government, at the instigation of
Maurepas, offered him an annual stipend of 20,000
francs, together with an additional 10,000 to support
an establishment for patients and pupils, if he would
stay in France. One unpleasant condition was attached
to this offer: he was required to allow three
nominees of the Crown to watch his proceedings. So
inordinately high did Mesmer rate his claims, that he
stood out for better terms, and like the dog of the
fable, by endeavoring to get too much, lost what he
might have secured. Ere long the Parisians recovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
something of common sense. The enthusiasm of the
hour subsided: and the Royal Commission, composed
of some of the best men of science to be found in the
entire world, were enabled to explain to the public
how they had been fooled by a trickster, and betrayed
into practices scarcely less offensive to modesty than
to reason. In addition to the public report, another
private one was issued by the commissioners, urging
the authorities, in the name of morality, to put a stop
to the mesmeric mania.</p>

<p>Mesmer died in obscurity on the 5th of March, in
the year 1815.</p>

<p>Animal magnetism, under the name of mesmerism,
has been made familiar of late years to the ears of
English people, if not to their understandings, by the
zealous and indiscreet advocacy which its absurdities
have met with in London and our other great cities.
It is true that the disciples have outrun their master—that
Mesmer has been out-mesmerized; but the same
criticisms which have been here made on the system of
the arch-charlatan may be applied to the vagaries of
his successors, whether they be dupes or rogues. To
electro-biologists, spirit-rappers, and table-turners the
same arguments must be used as we employ to mesmerists.
They must be instructed that phenomena
are not to be referred to magnetic influence, simply
because it is difficult to account for them; that it is
especially foolish to set them down to such a cause,
when they are manifestly the product of another
power; and that all the wonders which form the stock
of their conversation, and fill the pages of the <i>Zoist</i>,
are to be attributed, not to a lately discovered agency,
but to nervous susceptibility, imagination, and bodily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
temperament, aroused by certain well-known stimulants.</p>

<p>They will doubtless be disinclined to embrace this
explanation of their marvels, and will argue that it is
much more likely that a table is made by ten or twelve
gentlemen and ladies to turn rapidly round, without
the application of muscular force, than that these
ladies and gentlemen should delude themselves into an
erroneous belief that such a phenomenon has been
produced. To disabuse them of such an opinion, they
must be instructed in the wondrous and strangely delicate
mechanism of the human intellect and affections.
And after such enlightenment they must be hopelessly
dull or perverse if they do not see that the metaphysical
explanation of "their cases" is not only the
true one, but that it opens up to view far more astonishing
features in the constitution of man than any
that are dreamt of in the vain philosophy of mesmerism.
It is humiliating to think that these remarks
should be an appropriate comment on the silliness of
the so-called educated classes of the nineteenth century.
That they are out of place, none can advance,
when one of the most popular pulpit orators of London
has not hesitated to commit to print, in a work
of religious pretensions, the almost blasphemous suggestion
that table-turning is a phenomenon consequent
upon the first out-poured drops of "the seventh
vial" having reached the earth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<h3>MAKE WAY FOR THE LADIES!</h3>

<blockquote><p>"For in all times, in the opinion of the multitude, witches and
old women and impostors have had a competition with physicians.
And what followeth? Even this, that physicians
say to themselves, as Solomon expresseth it upon a higher
occasion, 'If it befall to me as befalleth to the fools, why
should I labour to be more wise?'"—Lord Bacon's <i>Advancement
of Learning</i>.</p></blockquote>


<p>It is time to say something about the ladies as physicians.
Once they were the chief practitioners of
medicine; and even to recent times had a monopoly of
that branch of art over which Dr. Locock presides.
The question has lately been agitated whether certain
divisions of remedial industry ought not again to be
set aside for them; and the patronage afforded to the
lady who (in spite of the ridicule thrown on her, and
the rejection of her advances by various medical
schools to which she applied for admission as a student),
managed to obtain a course of medical instruction
at one of the London schools, and practised for
a brief time in London previous to her departure for
a locality more suited to her operations, would seem
to indicate that public feeling is not averse to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
thought of employing—under certain conditions and
for certain purposes—female physicians.</p>

<p>Of the many doctresses who have flourished in
England during the last 200 years, only a few have
left any memorial of their actions behind them. Of
<i>the wise women</i> (a class of practitioners, by-the-by,
still to be found in many rural villages and in certain
parts of London) in whom our ancestors had as much
confidence as we of the present generation have in
the members of the College of Physicians, we question
if twoscore, including Margaret Kennix and Mrs.
Woodhouse, of the Elizabethan era, could be rescued
from oblivion. Some of them wrote books, and so, by
putting their names "in print," have a slight hold on
posthumous reputation. Two of them are immortalized
by mention in the records of the "Philosophical
Transactions for 1694." These ladies were Mrs. Sarah
Hastings and Mrs. French. The curious may refer
to the account there given of the ladies' skill; and
also, for further particulars relative to Sarah Hastings,
a glance may be given to M. de la Cross's "Memoirs
for the Ingenious," published in the month of
July, 1693. We do not care to transcribe the passages
into our own pages; though, now that it is the fashion
to treat all the unpleasant details of nursing as matters
of romance, we presume there is nothing in the
cases mentioned calculated to shock public delicacy.</p>

<p>A most successful "wise woman" was Joanna
Stephens, an ignorant and vulgar creature, who, just
before the middle of the last century, proclaimed
that she had discovered a sovereign remedy for a painful
malady, which, like the smallpox, has become in
the hands of modern surgery so manageable that ere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
long it will rank as little more than "a temporary
discomfort." Joanna was a courageous woman. She
went straightway to temporal peers, bishops, duchesses,
and told them she was the woman for their money.
They believed her, testified to the marvellous cures
which she had effected, and allowed her to make use
of their titles to awe sceptics into respect for her
powers. Availing herself of this permission, she published
books containing lists of her cures, backed up
by letters from influential members of the nobility and
gentry.</p>

<p>In the April number of the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
for the year 1738, one reads—"Mrs. Stephens has
proposed to make her medicine publick, on consideration
of £5000 to be raised by contribution and
lodged with Mr. Drummond, banker; he has received
since the 11th of this month about £500 on that account."
By the end of the month the banker had in
his hands £720 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></p>

<p>This generous offer was not made until the inventor
of the nostrums had enriched herself by enormous
fees drawn from the credulity of the rich of every
sect and rank. The subscription to pay her the
amount she demanded for her secret was taken up enthusiastically.
Letters appeared in the Journals and
Magazines, arguing that no humane or patriotic man
could do otherwise than contribute to it. The movement
was well whipped up by the press. The Bishop
of Oxford gave £10 10<i>s.</i>; Bishop of Gloucester, £10
10<i>s.</i>; The Earl of Pembroke, £50; Countess of Deloraine,
£5 5<i>s.</i>; Lady Betty Jermaine, £21; Lady Vere
Beauclerc, £10 10<i>s.</i>; Earl of Godolphin, £100; Duchess
of Gordon, £5 5<i>s.</i>: Viscount Lonsdale, £52 10<i>s.</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Duke of Rutland, £50; the Bishop of Salisbury, £25;
Sir James Lowther, Bart., £25; Lord Cadogan, £2 2<i>s.</i>;
Lord Cornwallis, £20; Duchess of Portland, £21; Earl
of Clarendon, £25; Lord Lymington, £5; Duke of
Leeds, £21; Lord Galloway, £30; General Churchill
(Spot Ward's friend), £10 10<i>s.</i>; Countess of Huntingdon,
£10 10<i>s.</i>; Hon. Frances Woodhouse, £10 10<i>s.</i>;
Sir Thomas Lowther, Bart., £5 5<i>s.</i>; Duke of Richmond,
£30; Sir George Saville, Bart., £5 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>These were only a few of the noble and distinguished
dupes of Joanna Stephens. Mrs. Crowe, in her
profound and philosophic work, "Spiritualism, and
the Age we live in," informs us that "the solicitude"
about the subject of table-turning "displayed by
many persons in high places, is the best possible sign
of the times; and it is one from which she herself
hopes that the period is arrived when we shall receive
further help from God." Hadn't Joanna Stephens
reason to think that the period had arrived when she
and her remedial system would receive further help
from God? What would not Read (we do not mean
the empiric oculist knighted by Queen Anne, but the
cancer quack of our own time) give to have such a
list of aristocratic supporters? What would not Mrs.
Doctor Goss (who in this year, 1861, boasts of the
patronage of "ladies of the highest distinction")
give for a similar roll of adherents?</p>

<p>The agitation, however, for a public subscription
for Joanna Stephens was not so successful as her
patrician supporters anticipated. They succeeded in
collecting £1356 3<i>s.</i> But Joanna stood out: her secret
should not go for less than £5000. "No pay, no
cure!" was her cry. The next thing her friends did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
was to apply to Parliament for the required sum—and,
positively, their request was granted. The nation,
out of its taxes, paid what the individuals of its
wealthy classes refused to subscribe. A commission
was appointed by Parliament, that gravely inquired
into the particulars of the cures alleged to be performed
by Joanna Stephens; and, finding the evidence
in favour of the lady unexceptionable, they
awarded her the following certificate, which ought to
be preserved to all ages as a valuable example of senatorial
wisdom:—</p>

<blockquote><p class="center">"<span class="smcap">The Certificate required by the Act of

<p>"We, whose names are underwritten, being the

<p>When such men as Cheselden, Hawkins, and
Sharp could sign such a certificate, we need feel no
surprise at the conduct of Dr. Nesbit and Dr. Pellet
(Mead's early friend, who rose to be president of
the College of Physicians). These two gentlemen,
who were on the commission, having some scruples
about the words "dissolving power," gave separate
testimonials in favour of the medicines. St. John
Long's cause, it may be remembered, was advocated
by Dr. Ramadge, a Fellow of the College.</p>

<p>The country paid its money, and obtained Joanna's
prescriptions. Here is a portion of the lady's statement:—</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>A full Discovery of the Medicines given by me,
Joanna Stephens, and a particular account of my
method of preparing and giving the same.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>"My medicines are a Powder, a Decoction, and
Pills.</p>

<p>"The Powder consists of egg-shells and snails—both
calcined.</p>

<p>"The Decoction is made by boiling some herbs (together
with a ball which consists of soap, swine's-cresses
burnt to a blackness, and honey) in water.</p>

<p>"The Pills consist of snails calcined, wild carrot
seeds, burdock seeds, ashen keys, hips and hawes—all
burnt to a blackness—soap and honey.</p>

<p>"The powder is thus prepared:—Take hen's egg-shells,
well drained from the whites, dry and clean;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
crush them small with the hands, and fill a crucible of
the twelfth size (which contains nearly three pints)
with them lightly, place it on the fire till the egg-shells
be calcined to a greyish white, and acquire an
acrid, salt taste: this will take up eight hours, at least.
After they are thus calcined, put them in a dry,
clean earthen pan, which must not be above three
parts full, that there may be room for the swelling
of the egg-shells in stacking. Let the pan stand uncovered
in a dry room for two months, and no longer;
in this time the egg-shells will become of a milder
taste, and that part which is sufficiently calcined
will fall into a powder of such a fineness, as to pass
through a common hairsieve, which is to be done accordingly.</p>

<p>"In like manner, take garden snails, with their
shells, cleaned from the dirt; fill a crucible of the
same size with them whole, cover it, and place it on
the fire as before, till the snails have done smoaking,
which will be in about an hour—taking care that
they do not continue in the fire after that. They are
then to be taken out of the crucible, and immediately
rubbed in a mortar to a fine powder, which ought to
be of a very dark-grey colour.</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Note.</i>—If pit-coal be made use of, it will be proper—in
order that the fire may the sooner burn clear on the top—that
large cinders, and not fresh coals, be placed upon the tiles
which cover the crucibles.</p></blockquote>

<p>"These powders being thus prepared, take the egg-shell
powder of six crucibles, and the snail-powder
of one; mix them together, and rub them in a mortar,
and pass them through a cypress sieve. This
mixture is immediately to be put up into bottles,
which must be close stopped, and kept in a dry place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
for use. I have generally added a small quantity
of swine's-cresses, burnt to a blackness, and
rubbed fine; but this was only with a view to disguise
it.</p>

<p>"The egg-shells may be prepared at any time of the
year, but it is best to do them in summer. The snails
ought only to be prepared in May, June, July, and
August; and I esteem those best which are done in
the first of these months.</p>

<p>"The decoction is thus prepared:—Take four
ounces and a half of the best Alicant soap, beat it in
a mortar with a large spoonful of swine's-cresses
burnt to a blackness, and as much honey as will
make the whole of the consistence of paste. Let this
be formed into a ball. Take this ball, and green
camomile, or camomile flowers, sweet fennel, parsley,
and burdock leaves, of each an ounce (when there
are not greens, take the same quantity of roots); slice
the ball, and boil them in two quarts of soft water
half an hour, then strain it off, and sweeten it with
honey.</p>

<p>"The pills are thus prepared:—Take equal quantities
by measure of snails calcined as before, of wild
carrot seeds, burdock seeds, ashen keys, hips and
hawes, all burnt to a blackness, or, which is the same
thing, till they have done smoaking; mix them together,
rub them in a mortar, and pass them through
a cypress sieve. Then take a large spoonful of this
mixture, and four ounces of the best Alicant soap,
and beat them in a mortar with as much honey as
will make the whole of a proper consistence for pills;
sixty of which are to be made out of every ounce of
the composition."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>Five thousand pounds for such stuff as this!—and
the time was coming when the nation grudged an inadequate
reward to Jenner, and haggled about the
purchase of Hunter's Museum!</p>

<p>But a more remarkable case of feminine success in
the doctoring line was that of Mrs. Mapp, who was
a contemporary of Mrs. Stephens. Under the patronage
of the Court, "Drop and Pill" Ward (or "Spot"
Ward, as he was also called, from a mole on his cheek)
was astonishing London with his cures, and his gorgeous
equipage which he had the royal permission
to drive through St. James Park, when the attention
of the fashionable world was suddenly diverted to
the proceeding of "Crazy Sally of Epsom." She
was an enormous, fat, ugly, drunken woman, known
as a haunter of fairs, about which she loved to reel,
screaming and abusive, in a state of roaring intoxication.
This attractive lady was a bone-setter; and
so much esteemed was she for skill in her art, that
the town of Epsom offered her £100 if she would reside
there for a year. The following passage we take
from the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for 1736: "Saturday
31. In the <i>Daily Advertiser</i>, July 28, Joshua Ward,
Esq., having the queen's leave, recites seven extraordinary
cases of persons which were cured by him,
and examined before her Majesty, June 7, objections
to which had been made in the <i>Grub Street Journal</i>,
June 24. But the attention of the public has been
taken off from the wonder-working Mr. Ward to a
strolling woman now at Epsom, who calls herself
Crazy Sally; and had performed cures in bone-setting
to admiration, and occasioned so great a resort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
that the town offered her 100 guineas to continue
there a year."</p>

<p>"Crazy Sally" awoke one morning and found herself
famous. Patients of rank and wealth flocked in
from every quarter. Attracted by her success, an Epsom
swain made an offer of marriage to Sally, which
she like a fool accepted. Her maiden name of Wallin
(she was the daughter of a Wiltshire bone-setter of
that name) she exchanged at the altar for that of
Mapp. If her marriage was not in all respects fortunate,
she was not burdened with much of her husband's
society. He lived with her only for a fortnight,
during which short space of time he thrashed
her soundly twice or thrice, and then decamped with
a hundred guineas of her earnings. She found consolation
for her wounded affections in the homage
of the world. She became a notoriety of the first
water, and every day some interesting fact appeared
about her in the prints and public journals. In one
we are told "the cures of the woman bone-setter of
Epsom are too many to be enumerated: her bandages
are extraordinary neat, and her dexterity in reducing
dislocations and setting fractured bones wonderful.
She has cured persons who have been twenty years
disabled, and has given incredible relief in the most
difficult cases. The lame come daily to her, and she
gets a great deal of money, persons of quality who
attend her operations making her presents."</p>

<p>Poets sounded her praises. Vide <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i>, August, 1736:</p>

<p>Mrs. Mapp continued to reside in Epsom, but she
visited London once a week. Her journeys to and
from the metropolis she performed in a chariot
drawn by four horses, with servants wearing splendid
liveries. She used to put up at the Grecian Coffee-House,
where Sir Hans Sloane witnessed her operations,
and was so favourably impressed by them,
that he put under her charge his niece, who was
suffering from a spinal affection, or, to use the exact
and scientific language of the newspapers, "whose
back had been broke nine years, and stuck out two
inches." The eminent lady went to the playhouse
in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields to see the <i>Husband's Relief</i>
acted. Her presence not only produced a crowded
house, but the fact that she sate between Taylor the
quack oculist on one side, and Ward the drysalter on
the other, gave occasion for the production of the following
epigram, the point of which is perhaps almost
as remarkable as its polish:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"While Mapp to the actors showed a kind regard,<br></span>
<span class="i0">On one side <i>Taylor</i> sat, on the other <i>Ward</i>;<br></span>
<span class="i0">When their mock persons of the drama came,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Both <i>Ward</i> and <i>Taylor</i> thought it hurt their fame;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">Wonder'd how Mapp could in good humour be,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'<i>Zoons!</i>' crys the manly dame, 'it hurts not me;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Quacks without art may either blind or kill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But demonstration proves that mine is skill.'"</span>
</div>

<p>On the stage, also, a song was sung in honour of
Mrs. Mapp, and in derision of Taylor and Ward. It
ran thus:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"You surgeons of London, who puzzle your pates,<br></span>

</div></div>

<p>On one occasion, as this lady was proceeding up the
Old Kent Road to the Borough, in her carriage and
four, dressed in a loosely-fitting robe-de-chambre, and
manifesting by her manner that she had partaken
somewhat too freely of Geneva water, she found herself
in a very trying position. Her fat frame, indecorous
dress, intoxication, and dazzling equipage,
were in the eyes of the mob such sure signs of royalty,
that she was immediately taken for a Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
lady, of German origin and unpopular repute, whose
word was omnipotent at St. James's.</p>

<p>Soon a crowd gathered round the carriage, and,
with the proper amount of swearing and yelling,
were about to break the windows with stones, when
the spirited occupant of the vehicle, acting very much
as Nell Gwyn did on a similar occasion, rose from
her seat, and letting down the glasses, exclaimed,
with an imprecation more emphatic than polite,
"— —! Don't you know me? I am Mrs. Mapp, the
bone-setter!"</p>

<p>This brief address so tickled the humour of the
mob, that the lady proceeded on her way amidst deafening
acclamations and laughter.</p>

<p>The Taylor mentioned as sitting on one side of
Mrs. Mapp in the playhouse was a notable character.
A cunning, plausible, shameless blackguard, he was
eminently successful in his vocation of quack. Dr.
King, in his "Anecdotes of his own Times," speaks of
him with respect. "I was at Tunbridge," says the
Doctor, "with Chevalier Taylor, the oculist. He
seems to understand the anatomy of the eye perfectly
well; he has a fine hand and good instruments, and
performs all his operations with great dexterity; but
he undertakes everything (even impossible cases),
and promises everything. No charlatan ever appeared
with fitter and more excellent talents, or to greater
advantage; he has a good person, is a natural orator,
and has a faculty of learning foreign languages.
He has travelled over all Europe, and has always with
him an equipage suitable to a man of the first quality;
and has been introduced to most of the sovereign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
princes, from whom he has received many marks of
their liberality and esteem."</p>

<p>Dr. King, in a Latin inscription to the mountebank,
says:—</p>

<p class="center">
"Hic est, hic vir est,<br>
Quem docti, indoctique omnes impense mirantur,<br>
Johannes Taylor;<br>
Cœcigenorum, cœcorum, cœcitantium,<br>
Quot quot sunt ubique,<br>
Spes unica—Solamen—Salus."
</p>

<p>The Chevalier Taylor (as he always styled himself),
in his travels about the country, used to give
lectures on "The Eye," in whatever place he tarried.
These addresses were never explanatory of the anatomy
of the organ, but mere absurd rhapsodies on it
as an ingenious and wonderful contrivance.</p>

<p>Chevalier's oration to the university of Oxford,
which is still extant, began thus:—</p>

<p>"The eye, most illustrious sons of the muses, most
learned Oxonians, whose fame I have heard celebrated
in all parts of the globe—the eye, that most amazing,
that stupendous, that comprehending, that incomprehensible,
that miraculous organ, the eye, is the Proteus
of the passions, the herald of the mind, the interpreter
of the heart, and the window of the soul.
The eye has dominion over all things. The world
was made for the eye, and the eye for the world.</p>

<p>"My subject is Light, most illustrious sons of literature—intellectual
light. Ah! my philosophical,
metaphysical, my classical, mathematical, mechanical,
my theological, my critical audience, my subject is
the eye. You are the eye of England!</p>

<p>"England has two eyes—Oxford and Cambridge.
They are the two eyes of England, and two intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
eyes. You are the right eye of England, the elder
sister in science, and the first fountain of learning
in all Europe. What filial joy must exult in my bosom,
in my vast circuit, as copious as that of the sun
himself, to shine in my course, upon this my native
soil, and give light even at Oxford!</p>

<p>"The eye is the husband of the soul!</p>

<p>"The eye is indefatigable. The eye is an angelic
faculty. The eye in this respect is a female. The
eye is never tired of seeing; that is, of taking in, assimilating,
and enjoying all Nature's vigour."</p>

<p>When the Chevalier was ranting on in this fashion
at Cambridge (of course there terming Oxford the
<i>left</i> eye of England), he undertook to express every
passion of the mind by the eye alone.</p>

<p>"Here you have surprise, gentlemen; here you have
delight; here you have terror!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried an undergraduate, "there's no merit
in that, for you tell us beforehand what the emotion
is. Now next time say nothing—and let me guess
what the feeling is you desire to express."</p>

<p>"Certainly," responded the Doctor, cordially;
"nothing can be more reasonable in the way of a
proposition. Now then, sir, what is this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, veneration, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Certainly—quite right—and this?"</p>

<p>"Pity."</p>

<p>"Of course, sir: you see it's impossible for an observant
gentleman like yourself to misunderstand the
language of the eye," answered the oculist, whose
plan was only to assent to his young friend's decisions.</p>

<p>In the year 1736, when the Chevalier was at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
height of his fame, he received the following humorous
letter:—</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Domine</span>,—O tu, qui in oculis hominum versaris,
et quamcunque tractas rem, <i>acu</i> tangis, salve! Tu,
qui, instar Phœbi, lumen orbi, et orbes luminibus
reddis, iterum salve!</p>

<p>"Cum per te Gallia, per te nostræ academiæ, duo
regni lumina, clarius intuentur, cur non ad urbem
Edinburgi, cum toties ubique erras, cursum tendis?
nam quædam cœcitas cives illic invasit. Ipsos magistratus
<i>Gutta Serena</i> occupavit, videntur enim videre,
sed nihil vident. Idcirco tu istam <i>Scoticam Nebulam</i>
ex oculis remove, et quodcunque latet in tenebris, in
lucem profer. Illi violenter carcerem, tu oculos leniter
reclude; illi lucem Porteio ademerunt, tu illis lucem
restitue, et quamvis fingant se dupliciter videre,
fac ut simpliciter tantum oculo irretorto conspiciant.
Peractoque cursu, ad Angliam redi artis tuæ plenus,
Toriosque (ut vulgo vocantur) qui adhuc cœcutiant
et hallucinantur, illuminato. Ab ipsis clericis, si qui
sint cœci ductores, nubem discute; immo ipso Sole
lunaque, cum laborant eclipsi, quæ, instar tui ipsius,
transit per varias regiones obumbrans, istam molem
caliginis amoveto. Sic eris Sol Mundi, sic eris non
solum nomine Sartor, sed re Oculorum omnium resarcitor;
sic omuis Charta Publica tuam Claritudinem
celebrabit, et ubicunque frontem tuam ostendis, nemo
non te, O vir spectatissime, admirabitur. Ipse lippus
scriptor hujus epistolæ maxime gauderet te Medicum
Illustrissimum, cum omnibus tuis oculatis testibus,
Vindsoriæ videre.—<span class="smcap">Vale.</span>"</p>

<p>The Chevalier had a son and a biographer in the
person of John Taylor, who, under the title of "John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Taylor, Junior," succeeded to his father's trumpet,
and blew it with good effect. The title-page of his
biography of his father enumerates some half-hundred
crowned or royal heads, to whose eyes the
"Chevalier John Taylor, Opthalmiater Pontifical,
Imperial, and Royal," administered.</p>

<p>But this work was feeble and contemptible compared
with the Chevalier's autobiographic sketch of
himself, in his proposal for publishing which he
speaks of his loves and adventures, in the following
modest style:—</p>

<p>"I had the happiness to be also personally known to
two of the most amiable ladies this age has produced—namely,
Lady Inverness and Lady Mackintosh;
both powerful figures, of great abilities, and of the
most pleasing address—both the sweetest prattlers,
the prettiest reasoners, and the best judges of the
charms of high life that I ever saw. When I first beheld
these wonders I gazed on their beauties, and
my attention was busied in admiring the order and
delicacy of their discourse, &amp;c. For were I commanded
to seek the world for a lady adorned with
every accomplishment that man thinks desirable in
the sex, I could only be determined by finding their
resemblance....</p>

<p>"I am perfectly acquainted with the history of Persia,
as well before as since the death of Thamas Kouli
Khan; well informed of the adventures of Prince
Heraclius; was personally known to a minister he
sent to Moscow in his first attempt to conquer that
country; and am instructed in the cruel manner of
putting out the eyes of conquered princes, and of cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
away the eyelids of soldiers taken in war, to make
them unfit for service.</p>

<p>"I have lived in many convents of friars of different
orders, been present at their creation to various
degrees, and have assisted at numberless entertainments
upon those occasions.</p>

<p>"I have been in almost every female nunnery in
all Europe (<i>on account of my profession</i>), and could
write many volumes on the adventures of these religious
beauties.</p>

<p>"I have been present at the making of nuns of
almost every order, and assisted at the religious feasts
given on those occasions.</p>

<p>"I have met with a very great variety of singular
religious people called Pilgrims.</p>

<p>"I have been present at many extraordinary diversions
designed for the amusement of the sovereign,
viz. hunting of different sorts of wild beasts, as in
Poland; bull-fighting, as in Spain.</p>

<p>"I am well acquainted with all the various punishments
for different crimes, as practised in every
nation—been present at the putting of criminals to
death by various ways, viz. striking off heads, breaking
on the wheel, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"I am also well instructed in the different ways of
giving the torture to extract confession—and am no
stranger to other singular punishments, such as impaling,
burying alive with head above ground, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"And lastly, I have assisted, have seen the manner
of embalming dead bodies of great personages, and
am well instructed in the manner practised in some
nations for preserving them entire for ages, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
little alteration of figure from what they were when
first deprived of life....</p>

<p>"All must agree that no man ever had a greater
variety of matter worthy to be conveyed to posterity.
I shall, therefore, give my best care to, so to paint my
thoughts, and give such a dress of the story of my
life, that tho' I shall talk of the Great, the Least shall
not find cause of offence."</p>

<p>The occasion of this great man issuing so modest a
proposal to the public is involved in some mystery.
It would seem that he determined to publish his own
version of his adventures, in consequence of being
dissatisfied with his son's sketch of them. John
Taylor, Junior, was then resident in Hatton Garden,
living as an eye-doctor, and entered into an arrangement
with a publisher, without his father's consent, to
write the Chevalier's biography. Affixed to the indecent
pamphlet, which was the result of this agreement,
are the following epistolary statements:—</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Son</span>,—If you should unguardedly have suffered
your name at the head of a work which must
make us all contemptible, this must be printed in it
as the best apology for yourself and father:—</p>

<p class="center">
"<small>TO THE PRINTER.</small></p>
<p class="signature">
"Oxford, Jan. 10, 1761.
</p>

<p>"My dear and only son having respectfully represented
to me that he has composed a work, intitled
<i>My Life and Adventures</i>, and requires my consent
for its publication, notwithstanding I am as yet a
stranger to the composition, and consequently can be
no judge of its merits, I am so well persuaded that my
son is in every way incapable of saying aught of his
father but what must redound to his honour and reputation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and so perfectly convinced of the goodness of
his heart, that it does not seem possible I should err
in my judgment, by giving my consent to a publication
of the said work. And as I have long been employed
in writing my own Life and Adventures,
which will with all expedition be published, 'twill
hereafter be left with all due attention to the candid
reader, whether the Life of the Father written by the
son, or the Life of the Father written by himself, best
deserves approbation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">The Chevalier Taylor</span>,<br>
"Opthalmiater, Pontifical, Imperial, and Royal.
</p>

<p>"* * * The above is a true copy of the letter
my Father sent me. All the answer I can make to the
bills he sends about the town and country is, that I
have maintained my mother these eight years, and do
this at the present time; and that, two years since, I
was concerned for him, for which I have paid near
£200.</p>

<p class="signature">
"As witness my hand,<br>
"<span class="smcap">John Taylor</span>, <i>Oculist</i>."</p>
<p>
"Hatton Garden."
</p></blockquote>

<p>It is impossible to say whether these differences
were genuine, or only feigned by the two quacks, in
order to keep silly people gossiping about them. Certainly
the accusations brought against the Chevalier,
that he had sponged on his son, and declined to support
his wife, are rather grave ones to introduce into
a make-believe quarrel. But, on the other hand,
when the Chevalier's autobiography appeared it was
prefaced with the following dedicatory letter to his
son:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p><blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Son</span>,—Can I do ill when I address to
you the story of your father's life? Whose name can
be so proper as your own to be prefixed to a work of
this kind? You who was born to represent me living,
when I shall cease to be—born to pursue that most
excellent and important profession to which I have
for so many years labored to be useful—born to defend
my cause and support my fame—may I not
<i>presume</i>, my son, that you will defend your father's
cause? May I not <i>affirm</i> that you, my son, will support
your father's fame? After having this said,
need I add more than remind you—that, to a father,
nothing can be so dear as a deserving son—nor state
so desirable as that of the man who holds his successor,
and knows him to be worthy. Be prosperous. Be
happy.</p>

<p class="signature">
"I am, your affectionate Father,
<br>
"<span class="smcap">The Chevalier John Taylor</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>This unctuous address to "my lion-hearted boy" is
equalled in drollery by many passages of the work
itself, which (in the language of the title-page) "contains
all most worthy the attention of a Traveller—also
a dissertation on the Art of Pleasing, with the
most interesting observations on the Force of Prejudice;
numberless adventures, as well amongst nuns
and friars as with persons in high life; with a description
of a great variety of the most admirable relations,
which, though told in his well-known peculiar
manner, each one is strictly true, and within the Chevalier's
own observations and knowledge."</p>

<p>Apart from the bombast of his style, the Chevalier's
"well-known peculiar manner" was remarkable
for little besides tautology and a fantastic arrangement
of words. In his orations, when he aimed at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
sublimity, he indulged in short sentences each of
which commenced with a genitive case followed by an
accusative; after which came the verb succeeded by
the nominative. Thus, at such crises of grandiloquence,
instead of saying, "I will lecture on the wonders
of the eye," he would invert the order to, "Of
the eye on the wonders lecture will I." By doing
this, he maintained that he surpassed the finest periods
of Tully! There is a letter in Nichols's "Literary
Anecdotes," in which a lecture given by this
mountebank at Northampton is excellently described.
"The doctor," says the writer, "appeared dressed in
black, with a long light flowing ty'd wig; ascended a
scaffold behind a large table raised about two feet
from the ground, and covered with an old piece of
tapestry, on which was laid a dark-coloured cafoy
chariot-seat with four black bunches (used upon
hearses) tyed to the corners for tassels, four large
candles on each side of the cushion, and a quart decanter
of drinking water, with a half-pint glass, to
moisten his mouth."</p>

<p>The fellow boasted that he was the author of forty-five
works in different languages. Once he had the
audacity to challenge Johnson to talk Latin with him.
The doctor responded with a quotation from Horace,
which the charlatan took to be the doctor's own composition.
"<i>He said a few words well enough</i>," Johnson
said magnanimously when he repeated the story
to Boswell. "Taylor," said the doctor, "is the most
ignorant man I ever knew, but sprightly; Ward, the
dullest."</p>

<p>John Taylor, Junr., survived his father more than
fifteen years, and to the last had a lucrative business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
in Hatton Garden. His father had been oculist to
George the Second; but this post, on the death of the
Chevalier, he failed to obtain, it being given to a
foreign <i>protégé</i> of the Duke of Bedford's. He made
a great noise about the sufferings of the poor, and
proposed to the different parishes of London to attend
the paupers labouring under diseases of the eye
at two guineas a-year for each parish. He was an illiterate,
vulgar, and licentious scoundrel; and yet
when he died, on the 17th September, 1787, he was
honoured with a long memoir in the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i>, as one "whose philanthropy was exerted
so fully as to class him with a Hanway or a Howard."</p>

<p>If an apology is needed for giving so much space, in
a chapter devoted to the ladies, to the John Taylors,
it must be grounded on the fact that the Chevalier
was the son of an honest widow woman who carried
on a respectable business, as an apothecary and doctress,
at Norwich. In this she resembled Mrs. Blood,
the wife of the Colonel of that name, who for years
supported herself and son at Romford, by keeping an
apothecary's shop under the name of Weston. Colonel
Blood was also himself a member of the Faculty.
For some time, whilst meditating his <i>grand coup</i>, he
practised as a doctor in an obscure part of the City,
under the name of Ayliffe.</p>

<p>Two hundred years since the lady practitioners of
medicine in the provinces not seldom had working
for them pupils and assistants of the opposite sex,
and this usage was maintained in secluded districts
till a comparatively recent date. In Houghton's Collection,
Nov. 15, 1695, is the following advertisement,—"If
any Apothecary's Widow that keeps a shop in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the country wants a journeyman that has lived 25
years for himself in London, and has had the conversation
of the eminent physicians of the colledge, I can
help to such an one."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<h3>MESSENGER MONSEY.</h3>


<p>Amongst the celebrities of the medical profession,
who have left no memorial behind them more durable
or better known than their wills in Doctors' Commons,
was Messenger Monsey, the great-grandfather
of our ex-Chancellor, Lord Cranworth.</p>

<p>We do not know whether his Lordship is aware of
his descent from the eccentric physician. Possibly he
is not, for the Monseys, though not altogether of a
plebeian stock, were little calculated to throw éclat
over the genealogy of a patrician house.</p>

<p>Messenger Monsey, who used with a good deal of
unnecessary noise to declare his contempt of the ancestral
honours which he in reality possessed, loved to
tell of the humble origin of his family. The first
Duke of Leeds delighted in boasting of his lucky progenitor,
Jack Osborn, the shop lad, who rescued his
master's daughter from a watery grave, in the
Thames, and won her hand away from a host of noble
suitors, who wanted—literally, the young lady's <i>pin</i>-money.
She was the only child of a wealthy pinmaker
carrying on his business on London Bridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
and the jolly old fellow, instead of disdaining to bestow
his heiress on a 'prentice, exclaimed, "Jack won
her, and he shall wear her!" Dr. Monsey, in the hey-day
of his social fame, told his friends that the first of
his ancestors of any note was a baker, and a retail
dealer in hops. At a critical point of this worthy
man's career, when hops were "down" and feathers
were "up," to raise a small sum of money for immediate
use he ripped open his beds, sold the feathers,
and stuffed the tick with unsaleable hops. Soon a
change in the market occurred, and once more operating
on the couches used by himself and children, he
sold the hops at a profit, and bought back the feathers.
"That's the way, sir, by which my family hopped
from obscurity!" the doctor would conclude.</p>

<p>We have reason for thinking that this ancestor was
the physician's great-grandfather. As is usually
found to be the case, where a man thinks lightly of
the advantages of birth, Messenger was by no means
of despicable extraction. His grandfather was a man
of considerable property, and married Elizabeth Messenger,
co-heir of Thomas Messenger, lord of Whitwell
Manor, in the county of Norfolk, a gentleman by
birth and position; and his father, the Rev. Robert
Monsey, a Norfolk rector, married Mary, the daughter
of Roger Clopton, rector of Downham. Of the
antiquity and importance of the Cloptons amongst
the gentle families of England this is no place to
speak; but further particulars relative to the Monsey
pedigree may be found by the curious in Bloomfield's
"History of Norfolk." On such a descent a Celt
would persuade himself that he represented kings
and rulers. Monsey, like Sydney Smith after him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
preferred to cover the whole question with jolly,
manly ridicule, and put it out of sight.</p>

<p>Messenger Monsey was born in 1693, and received
in early life an excellent education; for though his
father at the Revolution threw his lot in with the nonjurors,
and forfeited his living, the worthy clergyman
had a sufficient paternal estate to enable him to rear
his only child without any painful considerations of
cost. After spending five years at St. Mary's Hall,
Cambridge, Messenger studied physic for some time
under Sir Benjamin Wrench, at Norwich. Starting
on his own account, he practised for a while at Bury
St. Edmunds, in Suffolk, but with little success. He
worked hard, and yet never managed in that prosperous
and beautiful country town to earn more than
three hundred guineas in the same year. If we examined
into the successes of medical celebrities, we
should find in a great majority of cases fortune was
won by the aspirant either annexing himself to, and
gliding into the confidence of, a powerful clique, or
else by his being through some lucky accident thrown
in the way of a patron. Monsey's rise was of the latter
sort. He was still at Bury, with nothing before
him but the prospect of working all his days as a
country doctor, when Lord Godolphin, son of Queen
Anne's Lord Treasurer, and grandson of the great
Duke of Marlborough, was seized, on the road to
Newmarket, with an attack of apoplexy. Bury was
the nearest point where medical assistance could be
obtained. Monsey was summoned, and so fascinated
his patient with his conversational powers that his
Lordship invited him to London, and induced him to
relinquish his country practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>From that time Monsey's fortune was made. He
became to the Whigs very much what, in the previous
generation, Radcliffe had been to the Tories. Sir
Robert Walpole genuinely loved him, seizing every
opportunity to enjoy his society, and never doing
anything for him; and Lord Chesterfield was amongst
the most zealous trumpeters of his medical skill.
Lively, sagacious, well-read, and brutally sarcastic,
he had for a while a society reputation for wit
scarcely inferior to Swift's; and he lived amongst
men well able to judge of wit. Garrick and he were
for many years intimate friends, until, in a contest of
jokes, each of the two brilliant men lost his temper,
and they parted like Roland and Sir Leoline—never
to meet again. Garrick probably would have kept
his temper under any other form of ridicule, but he
never ceased to resent Monsey's reflection on his
avarice to the Bishop of Sodor and Man.</p>

<p>"Garrick is going to quit the stage," observed the
Bishop.</p>

<p>"That he'll never do," answered Monsey, making
use of a Norfolk proverb, "so long as he knows a
guinea is cross on one side and pile on the other."</p>

<p>This speech was never forgiven. Lord Bath endeavoured
to effect a reconciliation between the divided
friends, but his amiable intention was of no
avail.</p>

<p>"I thank you," said Monsey; "but why will your
Lordship trouble yourself with the squabbles of a
Merry Andrew and quack doctor?"</p>

<p>When the tragedian was on his death-bed, Monsey
composed a satire on the sick man, renewing the
attack on his parsimony. Garrick's illness, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
terminating fatally, the doctor destroyed his verses,
but some scraps of them still remain to show their
spirit and power. A consultation of physicians was
represented as being held over the actor:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Seven wise physicians lately met,<br></span>
<span class="i1">To save a wretched sinner;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Come, Tom, said Jack, pray let's be quick,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Or I shall lose my dinner.<br></span>
<span class="i1"> .    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   .    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   .  &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;      .<br></span>
<span class="i0">"Some roared for rhubarb, jalap some,<br></span>
<span class="i1">And some cried out for Dover;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Lets give him something, each man said—<br></span>
<span class="i1">Why e'en let's give him—over."</span>
</div>

<p>After much learned squabbling, one of the sages
proposed to revive the sinking energies of the poor
man by jingling guineas in his ears. The suggestion
was acted upon, when—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Soon as the fav'rite sound he heard,<br></span>
<span class="i1">One faint effort he try'd;<br></span>
<span class="i0">He op'd his eyes, he stretched his hands,<br></span>
<span class="i1">He made one grasp—and dy'd."</span>
</div>

<p>Though, on the grave closing over his antagonist,
Monsey suppressed these lines, he continued to cherish
an animosity to the object of them. The spirit in
which, out of respect to death, he drew a period to
their quarrel, was much like that of the Irish peasant
in the song, who tells his ghostly adviser that he forgives
Pat Malone with all his heart (supposing death
should get the better of him)—but should he recover,
he means to pay the rascal off roundly. Sir Walter
Scott somewhere tells a story of a Highland chief, in
his last moments declaring that he from the bottom of
his heart forgave his old enemy, the head of a hostile
clan—and concluding this Christian avowal with a
final address to his son—"But may all evil light upon
ye, Ronald, if ye e'er forgie the heathen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>Through Lord Godolphin's interest, Monsey was
appointed physician to Chelsea College, on the death
of Dr. Smart. For some time he continued to reside
in St. James's: but on the death of his patron he
moved to Chelsea, and spent the last years of his life
in retirement—and to a certain extent banishment—from
the great world. The hospital offices were then
filled by a set of low-born scoundrels, or discharged
servants, whom the ministers of various Cabinets had
had some reason of their own for providing for. The
surgeon was that Mr. Ranby who positively died of
rage because Henry Fielding's brother (Sir John)
would not punish a hackney coachman who had been
guilty of the high treason of—being injured and
abused by the plaintiff. With this man Monsey had
a tremendous quarrel; but though in the right, he
had to submit to Ranby's powerful connections.</p>

<p>This affair did not soften his temper to the other
functionaries of the hospital with whom he had to
associate at the hall table. His encounter with the
venal elector who had been nominated to a Chelsea
appointment is well known, though an account of it
would hurt the delicacy of these somewhat prudish
pages. Of the doctor's insolence the following is a
good story:—</p>

<p>A clergyman, who used to bore him with pompous
and pedantic talk, was arguing on some point with
Monsey, when the latter exclaimed:—</p>

<p>"Sir, if you have faith in your opinion, will you
venture a wager upon it?"</p>

<p>"I could—but I won't," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then," rejoined Monsey, "you have very little
wit, or very little money." The logic of this retort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
puts one in mind of the eccentric actor who, under
somewhat similar circumstances, asked indignantly,
"Then, sir, how <i>dare</i> you advance a statement in a
public room which you are not prepared to substantiate
with a bet!"</p>

<p>Monsey was a Unitarian, and not at all backward to
avow his creed. As he was riding in Hyde Park with
a Mr. Robinson, that gentleman, after deploring the
corrupt morals of the age, said, with very bad taste,
"But, Doctor, I talk with one who believes there is no
God." "And I," retorted Monsey, "with one who
believes there are three." Good Mr. Robinson was so
horrified that he clapped spurs to his horse, galloped
off, and never spoke to the doctor again.</p>

<p>Monsey's Whiggism introduced him to high society,
but not to lucrative practice. Sir Robert Walpole
always extoled the merits of his "Norfolk Doctor,"
but never advanced his interests. Instead of covering
the great minister with adulation, Monsey treated
him like an ordinary individual, telling him when his
jokes were poor, and not hesitating to worst him in
argument. "How happens it," asked Sir Robert,
over his wine, "that nobody will beat me at billiards,
or contradict me, but Dr. Monsey!" "Other people,"
put in the doctor, "get places—I get a dinner
and praise." The Duke of Grafton treated him even
worse. His Grace staved off paying the physician his
bill for attending him and his family at Windsor,
with promises of a place. When "the little place"
fell vacant, Monsey called on the duke, and reminded
him of his promise. "Ecod—ecod—ecod," was the
answer, "but the Chamberlain has just been here to
tell me he has promised it to Jack ——." When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
disappointed applicant told the lord-chamberlain
what had transpired, his Lordship replied, "Don't,
for the world, tell his Grace; but before he knew I
had promised it, here is a letter he sent me, soliciting
for <i>a third person</i>."</p>

<p>Amongst the vagaries of this eccentric physician
was the way in which he extracted his own teeth.
Round the tooth sentenced to be drawn he fastened
securely a strong piece of catgut, to the opposite end
of which he affixed a bullet. With this bullet and a
full measure of powder a pistol was charged. On the
trigger being pulled, the operation was performed
effectually and speedily. The doctor could only
rarely prevail on his friends to permit him to remove
their teeth by this original process. Once a gentleman
who had agreed to try the novelty, and had even
allowed the apparatus to be adjusted, at the last
moment exclaimed, "Stop, stop, I've changed my
mind!" "But I haven't, and you're a fool and a
coward for your pains," answered the doctor, pulling
the trigger. In another instant the tooth was extracted,
much to the timid patient's delight and
astonishment.</p>

<p>At Chelsea, to the last, the doctor saw on friendly
terms all the distinguished medical men of his day.
Cheselden, fonder of having his horses admired than
his professional skill extolled, as Pope and Freind
knew, was his frequent visitor. He had also his loves.
To Mrs. Montague, for many years, he presented a
copy of verses on the anniversary of her birth-day.
But after his quarrel with Garrick, he saw but little
of the lady, and was rarely, if ever, a visitor at her
magnificent house in Portman Square. Another of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
his flames, too, was Miss Berry, of whom the loss still
seems to be recent. In his old age, avarice—the very
same failing he condemned so much in Garrick—developed
itself in Monsey. In comparatively early life
his mind was in a flighty state about money matters.
For years he was a victim of that incredulity which
makes the capitalist imagine a great and prosperous
country to be the most insecure of all debtors. He
preferred investing his money in any wild speculation
to confiding it to the safe custody of the funds.
Even his ready cash he for long could not bring himself
to trust in the hands of a banker. When he left
town for a trip, he had recourse to the most absurd
schemes for the protection of his money. Before setting
out, on one occasion, for a journey to Norfolk,
incredulous with regard to cash-boxes and bureaus,
he hid a considerable quantity of gold and notes in
the fireplace of his study, covering them up artistically
with cinders and shavings. A month afterwards,
returning (luckily a few days before he was expected),
he found his old house-maid preparing to entertain
a few friends at tea in her master's room. The
hospitable domestic was on the point of lighting the
fire, and had just applied a candle to the doctor's
notes, when he entered the room, seized on a pail of
water that chanced to be standing near, and, throwing
its contents over the fuel and the old woman, extinguished
the fire and her presence of mind at the
same time. Some of the notes, as it was, were injured,
and the Bank of England made objections to cashing
them.</p>

<p>To the last Monsey acted by his own rules instead
of by those of other people. He lived to extreme old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
age, dying in his rooms in Chelsea College, on December
26th, 1788, in his ninety-fifth year; and his will
was as remarkable as any other feature of his career.
To a young lady mentioned in it, with the most lavish
encomiums on her wit, taste, and elegance, was
left an old battered snuff-box—not worth sixpence;
and to another young lady, whom the testator says he
intended to have enriched with a handsome legacy, he
leaves the gratifying assurance that he changed his
mind on finding her "a pert, conceited minx." After
inveighing against bishops, deans, and chapters, he
left an annuity to two clergymen who had resigned
their preferment on account of the Athanasian doctrine.
He directed that his body should not be insulted
with any funeral ceremony, but should undergo
dissection; after which, the "remainder of my
carcase" (to use his own words) "may be put into a
hole, or crammed into a box with holes, and thrown
into the Thames." In obedience to this part of the
will, Mr. Forster, surgeon, of Union Court, Broad
Street, dissected the body, and delivered a lecture on
it to the medical students in the theatre of Guy's
Hospital. The bulk of the doctor's fortune, amounting
to about £16,000, was left to his only daughter
for life, and after her demise, by a complicated entail,
to her <i>female</i> descendants. This only child, Charlotte
Monsey, married William Alexander, a linen-draper
in Cateaton Street, City, and had a numerous family.
One of her daughters married the Rev. Edmund
Rolfe, rector of Cockley Clay, Norfolk, of which
union Robert Monsey Rolfe, Baron Cranworth of
Cranworth, county of Norfolk, is the offspring.</p>

<p>Before making the above-named and final disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
of his body, the old man found vent for his ferocious
cynicism and vulgar infidelity in the following
epitaph, which is scarcely less characteristic of the
society in which the writer had lived, than it is of the
writer himself:—</p>

<p class="center">
"<small>MOUNSEY'S EPITAPH, WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.</small>"<br>
</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Here lie my old bones; my vexation now ends;<br></span>
<span class="i0">I have lived much too long for myself and my friends.<br></span>
<span class="i0">As to churches and churchyards, which men may call holy,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis a rank piece of priestcraft, and founded on folly.<br></span>
<span class="i0">What the next world may be never troubled my pate;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And be what it may, I beseech you, O fate,<br></span>
<span class="i0">When the bodies of millions rise up in a riot,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To let the old carcase of Mounsey be quiet."</span>
</div>

<p>Unpleasant old scamp though he in many respects
was, Monsey retains even at this day so firm a hold of
the affections of all students who like ferreting into
the social history of the last century, that no chance
letter of his writing is devoid of interest. The following
specimen of his epistolary style, addressed to his
fair patient, the accomplished and celebrated Mrs.
Montague (his acquaintance with which lady has
already been alluded to), is transcribed from the
original manuscript in the possession of Dr. Diamond:—</p>

<blockquote><p class="signature">
"4th of March, a minute past 12.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Madame</span>,
</p>

<p>"Now dead men's ghosts are getting out
of their graves, and there comes the ghost of a doctor
in a white sheet to wait upon you. Your Tokay is got
into my head and your love into my heart, and they
both join to club their thanks for the pleasantest day
I have spent these seven years; and to my comfort I
find a man may be in love, and be happy, provided
he does not go to book for it. I could have trusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
till the morning to show my gratitude, but the Tokay
wou'd have evaporated, and then I might have had
nothing to talk of but an ache in my head and pain
in my heart. Bacchus and Cupid should always be
together, for the young gentleman is very apt to be
silly when he's alone by himself; but when old toss-pot
is with him, if he pretends to fall a whining, he
hits him a cursed knock on the pate, and says: 'Drink
about, you....' 'No, Bacchus, don't be in a passion.
Upon my soul you have knocked out one of my eyes!'
'Eyes, ye scroundrel? Why, you have never had one
since you were born.... Apollo would have couched
you, but your mother said no; for then, says she, "he
can never be blamed for his shot, any more than the
people that are shot at." She knew 'twould bring
grist to her mill; for what with those who pretended
they were in love and were not so, and those who were
really so and wouldn't own it, I shall find rantum
scantum work at Cyprus, Paphos, and Cythera.
Some will come to acquire what they never had, and
others to get rid of what they find very troublesome,
and I shall mind none of 'em.' You see how the goddess
foresaw and predicted my misfortunes. She
knew I was a sincere votary, and that I was a martyr
to her serene influence. Then how could you use me
so like an Hyrcanian tygress, and be such an infidel
to misery; that though I hate you mortally, I wish
you may feel but one poor <i>half-quarter-of-an-hour</i>
before you slip your breath—how shall I rejoice at
your horrid agonies? <i>Nec enim lex justior ulla Quam
necis artifices arte perire suâ</i>—Remember Me.</p>

<p>"My ills have disturbed my brain, and the revival
of old ideas has set it a-boyling, that, till I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
skim'd off the froth, I can't pretend to say a word for
myself; and by the time I have cleared off the scum,
the little grudge that is left may be burnt to the bottom
of the pot.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"My mortal injuries have turned my mind,<br></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>AKENSIDE.</h3>


<p>There were two Akensides—Akenside the poet, and
Akenside the man; and of the <i>man</i> Akenside there
were numerous subdivisions. Remarkable as a poet,
he was even yet more noteworthy a private individual
in his extreme inconsistency. No character is more
commonplace than the one to which is ordinarily applied
the word contradictory; but Akenside was a
curiosity from the extravagance in which this form
of "the commonplace" exhibited itself in his disposition
and manners.</p>

<p>By turns he was placid, irritable, simple, affected,
gracious, haughty, magnanimous, mean, benevolent,
harsh, and sometimes even brutal. At times he was
marked by a childlike docility, and at other times his
vanity and arrogance displayed him almost as a madman.
Of plebeian extraction, he was ashamed of his
origin, and yet was throughout life the champion of
popular interests. Of his real humanity there can
be no doubt, and yet in his demeanour to the unfortunate
creatures whom, in his capacity of a hospital-physician,
he had to attend, he was always
supercilious, and often cruel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>Like Byron, he was lame, one of his legs being
shorter than the other; and of this personal disfigurement
he was even more sensitive than was the author
of "Childe Harold" of his deformity. When his
eye fell on it he would blush, for it reminded him of
the ignoble condition in which he was born. His
father was a butcher at Newcastle-upon-Tyne; and
one of his cleavers, falling from the shop-block, had
irremediably injured the poet's foot, when he was
still a little child.</p>

<p>Akenside was not only the son of a butcher—but,
worse still, a Nonconformist butcher; and from an
early period of his life he was destined to be a sectarian
minister. In his nineteenth year he was sent
to Edinburgh to prosecute his theological studies, the
expenses of this educational course being in part defrayed
by the Dissenters' Society. But he speedily
discovered that he had made a wrong start, and persuaded
his father to refund the money the Society
had advanced, and to be himself at the cost of educating
him as a physician. The honest tradesman
was a liberal and affectionate parent. Mark remained
three years at Edinburgh, a member of the Medical
Society, and an industrious student. On leaving
Edinburgh he practised for a short time as a surgeon
at Newcastle; after which he went to Leyden, and
having spent three months in that university took
his degree of doctor of physic, May 16, 1744. At
Leyden he became warmly attached to a fellow-student
named Dyson; and wonderful to be related,
the two friends, notwithstanding one was under
heavy pecuniary obligations to the other, and they
were very unlike each other in some of their principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
characteristics, played the part of Pylades and
Orestes, even into the Valley of Death. Akenside
was poor, ardent, and of a nervous, poetic temperament.
Dyson was rich, sober, and matter-of-fact, a
prudent place-holder. He rose to be clerk of the
House of Commons, and a Lord of the Treasury; but
the atmosphere of political circles and the excitement
of public life never caused his heart to forget its early
attachment. Whilst the poet lived Dyson was his
munificent patron, and when death had stepped in
between them, his literary executor. Indeed, he allowed
him for years no less a sum than £300 per
annum.</p>

<p>Akenside was never very successful as a physician,
although he thoroughly understood his profession,
and in some important particulars advanced its
science. Dyson introduced him into good society,
and recommended him to all his friends; but the
greatest income Akenside ever made was most probably
less than what he obtained from his friend's generosity.
Still, he must have earned something, for
he managed to keep a carriage and pair of horses;
and £300 per annum, although a hundred years ago
that sum went nearly twice as far as it would now,
could not have supported the equipage. His want of
patients can easily be accounted for. He was a vain,
tempestuous, crotchety little man, little qualified to
override the prejudices which vulgar and ignorant
people cherish against lawyers and physicians who
have capacity and energy enough to distinguish
themselves in any way out of the ordinary track of
their professional duties.</p>

<p>He was admitted, by mandamus, to a doctor's degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
at Cambridge; and became a fellow of the Royal
Society, and a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.
He tried his luck at Northampton, and
found he was not needed there; he became an inhabitant
of Hampstead, but failed to ingratiate himself
with the opulent gentry who in those days resided in
that suburb; and lastly fixed himself in Bloomsbury
Square (ætat. 27), where he resided till his death.
After some delay, he became a physician of St.
Thomas's Hospital, and an assistant physician of
Christ's Hospital—read the Gulstonian Lectures before
the College of Physicians, in 1755—and was also
Krohnian Lecturer. In speeches and papers to
learned societies, and to various medical treatises,
amongst which may be mentioned his "De Dysentariâ
Commentarius," he tried to wheedle himself
into practice. But his efforts were of no avail. Sir
John Hawkins, in his absurd Life of Dr. Johnson,
tells a good story of Saxby's rudeness to the author
of the "Pleasures of Imagination." Saxby was a
custom-house clerk, and made himself liked in society
by saying the rude things which other people had the
benevolence to feel, but lacked the hardihood to utter.
One evening, at a party, Akenside argued, with much
warmth and more tediousness, that physicians were
better and wiser men than the world ordinarily
thought.</p>

<p>"Doctor," said Saxby, "after all you have said, my
opinion of the profession is this: the ancients endeavoured
to make it a science, and failed; and the
moderns to make it a trade, and succeeded."</p>

<p>He was not liked at St. Thomas's Hospital. The
gentle Lettsom, whose mild poetic nature had surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
the author of "The Pleasures of Imagination"
with a halo of romantic interest, when he entered
himself a student of that school, was shocked at
finding the idol of his admiration so irritable and unkindly
a man. He was, according to Lettsom's reminiscences,
thin and pale, and of a strumous countenance.
His injured leg was lengthened by a false
heel. In dress he was scrupulously neat and delicate,
always having on his head a well-powdered white wig,
and by his side a long sword. Any want of respect to
him threw him into a fit of anger. One amongst the
students who accompanied him on a certain occasion
round the wards spat on the floor behind the physician.
Akenside turned sharply on his heel, and demanded
who it was that dared to spit in his face. To
the poor women who applied to him for medical advice
he exhibited his dislike in the most offensive and
cruel manner. The students who watched him
closely, and knew the severe disappointment his affections
had suffered in early life, whispered to the
novice that the poet-physician's moroseness to his
female patients was a consequence of his having felt
the goads of despised love. The fastidiousness of the
little fellow at having to come so closely in contact
with the vulgar rabble, induced him sometimes to
make the stronger patients precede him with brooms
and clear a way for him through the crowd of diseased
wretches. Bravo, my butcher's boy! This story
of Akenside and his lictors, pushing back the unsightly
mob of lepers, ought to be read side by side
with that of the proud Duke of Somerset, who, when
on a journey, used to send outriders before him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
clear the roads, and prevent vulgar eyes from looking
at him.</p>

<p>On one occasion Akenside ordered an unfortunate
male patient of St. Thomas's to take boluses of bark.
The poor fellow complained that he could not swallow
them. Akenside was so incensed at the man's
presuming to have an opinion on the subject, that he
ordered him to be turned out of the hospital, saying,
"He shall not die under my care." A man who
would treat his <i>poor</i> patients in this way did not deserve
to have any <i>rich</i> ones. These excesses of folly
and brutality, however, ere long reached the ears of
honest Richard Chester, one of the governors, and
that good fellow gave the doctor a good scolding,
roundly telling him, "Know, thou art a servant of
this charity."</p>

<p>Akenside's self-love received a more humorous stab
than the poke administered by Richard Chester's
blunt cudgel, from Mr. Baker, one of the surgeons at
St. Thomas's. To appreciate the full force of the
story, the reader must recollect that the jealousy,
which still exists between the two branches of the
medical profession, was a century since so violent
that even considerations of interest failed in some
cases to induce eminent surgeons and physicians to
act together. One of Baker's sons was the victim
of epilepsy, and frequent fits had impaired his faculties.
Baker was naturally acutely sensitive of his
child's misfortune, and when Akenside had the bad
taste to ask to what study the afflicted lad intended to
apply, the father answered, "I find he is not capable
of making a surgeon, so I have sent him to Edinburgh
to make a physician of him." Akenside felt this sarcasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
so much, that he for a long time afterward refused
to hold any intercourse with Baker.</p>

<p>But Akenside had many excuses for his irritability.
He was very ambitious, and failed to achieve that success
which the possession of great powers warranted
him in regarding as his due. It was said of Garth
that no physician understood his art more, or his
trade less! and this, as Mr. Bucke, in his beautiful
"Life of Arkenside," remarks, was equally true of
the doctor of St. Thomas's. He had a thirst for
human praise and worldly success, and a temperament
that caused him, notwithstanding all his sarcasms
against love, to estimate at their full worth the
joys of married life; yet he lived all his days a poor
man, and died a bachelor. Other griefs also contributed
to sour his temper. His lot was cast in times that
could not justly appreciate his literary excellences.
His sincere admiration of classic literature and art
and manners was regarded by the coarse herd of rich
and stupid Londoners as so perfectly ridiculous, that
when Smollett had the bad taste to introduce him
into <i>Peregrine Pickle</i>, as the physician who gives a
dinner after the manner of the ancients, the applause
was general, and every city tradesman, with scholarship
enough to read the novel, had a laugh at the expense
of a man who has some claims to be regarded
as the greatest literary genius of his time. The polished
and refined circles of English life paid homage
to his genius, but even in them he failed to meet with
the cordial recognition he deserved. Johnson, though
he placed him above Gray and Mason, did not do him
justice. Boswell didn't see much in him. Horace
Walpole differed from the friend who asked him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
admire the "Pleasures of Imagination." The poets
and wits of his own time had a high respect for his
critical opinion, and admitted the excellence of his
poetry—but almost invariably with some qualification.
And Akenside was one who thirsted for the
complete assent of the applauding world. He died
after a brief illness in his forty-ninth year, on the
23rd of June, 1770; and we doubt not, when the
Angel of Death touched him, the heart that ceased to
beat was one that had known much sorrow.</p>

<p>Akenside's poetical career was one of unfulfilled
promise. At the age of twenty-three he had written
"The Pleasures of the Imagination." Pope was so
struck with the merits of the poem, that when Dodsley
consulted him about the price set on it by the
author (£120), he told him to make no niggardly
offer, for it was the work of no every-day writer. But
he never produced another great work. Impressed
with the imperfections of his achievement, he occupied
himself with incessantly touching and re-touching
it up, till he came to the unwise determination of
re-writing it. He did not live to accomplish this suicidal
task; but the portion of it which came to the
public was inferior to the original poem, both in
power and art.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<h3>LETTSOM.</h3>


<p>High amongst literary, and higher yet amongst
benevolent, physicians must be ranked John Coakley
Lettsom, formerly president of the Philosophical
Society of London. A West Indian, and the son of a
planter, he was born on one of his father's little
islands, Van Dyke, near Tortola, in the year 1744.
Though bred a Quaker, he kept his heart so free from
sectarianism, and his life so entirely void of the formality
and puritanic asceticism of the Friends, that
his ordinary acquaintance marvelled at his continuing
to wear the costume of the brotherhood. At six
years of age he was sent to England for education,
being for that purpose confided to the protection of
Mr. Fothergill, of Warrington, a Quaker minister,
and younger brother of Dr. John Fothergill. After
receiving a poor preparatory education, he was apprenticed
to a Yorkshire apothecary, named Sutcliffe,
who, by industry and intelligence, had raised himself
from the position of a weaver to that of the first medical
practitioner of Settle. In the last century a West
Indian was, to the inhabitants of a provincial district,
a rare curiosity; and Sutcliffe's surgery, on the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
that Lettsom entered it in his fifteenth year, was surrounded
by a dense crowd of gaping rustics, anxious
to see a young gentleman accustomed to walk on his
head. This extraordinary demonstration of curiosity
was owing to the merry humour of Sutcliffe's senior
apprentice, who had informed the people that the
new pupil, who would soon join him, came from a
country where the feet of the inhabitants were placed
in an exactly opposite direction to those of Englishmen.</p>

<p>Sutcliffe did not find his new apprentice a very
handy one. "Thou mayest make a physician, but I
think not a good apothecary," the old man was in the
habit of saying; and the prediction in due course
turned out a correct one. Having served an apprenticeship
of five years, and walked for two the wards
of St. Thomas's Hospital, where Akenside was a physician,
conspicuous for supercilious manner and want
of feeling, Lettsom returned to the West Indies, and
settled as a medical practitioner in Tortola. He practised
there only five months, earning in that time the
astonishing sum of £2000; when, ambitious of achieving
a high professional position, he returned to
Europe, visited the medical schools of Paris and
Edinburgh, took his degree of M.D. at Leyden on the
20th of June, 1769, was admitted a licentiate of the
Royal College of Physicians of London in the same
year, and in 1770 was elected a fellow of the Society
of Antiquaries.</p>

<p>From this period till his death, in 1815 (Nov. 20),
he was one of the most prominent figures in the scientific
world of London. As a physician he was a most
fortunate man; for without any high reputation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
professional acquirements, and with the exact reverse
of a good preliminary education, he made a larger income
than any other physician of the same time. Dr.
John Fothergill never made more than £5000 in one
year; but Lettsom earned £3600 in 1783—£3900 in
1784—£4015 in 1785-and £4500 in 1786. After that
period his practice rapidly increased, so that in some
years his receipts were as much as £12,000. But
although he pocketed such large sums, half his
labours were entirely gratuitous. Necessitous clergymen
and literary men he invariably attended with
unusual solicitude and attention, but without ever
taking a fee for his services. Indeed, generosity was
the ruling feature of his life. Although he burdened
himself with the public business of his profession, was
so incessantly on the move from one patient to
another that he habitually knocked up three pairs of
horses a-day, and had always some literary work or
other upon his desk, he nevertheless found time to do
an amount of labour, in establishing charitable institutions
and visiting the indigent sick, that would by
itself have made a reputation for an ordinary person.</p>

<p>To give the mere list of his separate benevolent
services would be to write a book about them. The
General Dispensary, the Finsbury Dispensary, the
Surrey Dispensary, and the Margate Sea-bathing Infirmary,
originated in his exertions; and he was one
of the first projectors of—the Philanthropic Society,
St. Georges-in-the-Fields, for the Prevention of
Crimes, and the Reform of the Criminal Poor; the
Society for the Discharge and Relief of Persons Imprisoned
for Small Debts; the Asylum for the Indigent
Deaf and Dumb; the Institution for the Relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and Employment of the Indigent Blind; and the
Royal Humane Society, for the recovery of the apparently
drowned or dead. And year by year his pen
sent forth some publication or other to promote the
welfare of the poor, and succour the afflicted. Of
course there were crowds of clever spectators of the
world's work, who smiled as the doctor's carriage
passed them in the streets, and said he was a deuced
clever fellow to make ten thousand a-year so easily;
and that, after all, philanthropy was not a bad trade.
But Lettsom was no calculating humanitarian, with a
tongue discoursing eloquently on the sufferings of
mankind, and an eye on the sharp look-out for his
own interest. What he was before the full stare of
the world, that he was also in his own secret heart,
and those private ways into which hypocrisy cannot
enter. At the outset of his life, when only twenty-three
years old, he liberated his slaves—although they
constituted almost his entire worldly wealth, and he
was anxious to achieve distinction in a profession
that offers peculiar difficulties to needy aspirants.
And when his career was drawing to a close, he had
to part with his beloved countryseat because he had
impoverished himself by lavish generosity to the unfortunate.</p>

<p>There was no sanctimonious affectation in the
man. He wore a drab coat and gaiters, and made the
Quaker's use of <i>Thou</i> and <i>Thee</i>; but he held himself
altogether apart from the prejudices of his sect. A
poet himself of some respectability, he delighted in
every variety of literature, and was ready to shake
any man by the hand—Jew or Gentile. He liked pictures
and works of sculpture, and spent large sums<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
upon them; into the various scientific movements of
the time he threw himself with all the energy of his
nature; and he disbursed a fortune in surrounding
himself at Camberwell with plants from the tropics.
He liked good wine, but never partook of it to excess,
although his enemies were ready to suggest that he
was always glad to avail himself of an excuse for getting
intoxicated. And he was such a devoted admirer
of the fair sex, that the jealous swarm of needy men
who envied him his prosperity, had some countenance
for their slander that he was a Quaker debauchee.
He married young, and his wife outlived him; but as
a husband he was as faithful as he proved in every
other relation of life.</p>

<p>Saturday was the day he devoted to entertaining
his friends at Grove Hill, Camberwell; and rare parties
there gathered round him—celebrities from every
region of the civilized world, and the best "good fellows"
of London. Boswell was one of his most frequent
guests, and, in an ode to Charles Dilly, celebrated
the beauties of the physician's seat and his
humane disposition:—</p>

<span class="i1">To aid in his ambition.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"From terrace high he feasts his eye,<br></span>
<span class="i1">When practice grants a furlough;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, while it roves o'er Dulwich groves,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Looks down—even upon Thurlow."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>The concluding line is an allusion to the Lord
Chancellor's residence at Dulwich.</p>

<p>In person, Lettsom was tall and thin—indeed,
almost attenuated: his face was deeply lined, indicating
firmness quite as much as benevolence; and his
complexion was of a dark yellow hue. His eccentricities
were numerous. Like the founder of his sect, he
would not allow even respect for royalty to make an
alteration in his costume which his conscience did not
approve; and George III., who entertained a warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
regard for him, allowed him to appear at Court in
the ordinary Quaker garb, and to kiss his hand,
though he had neither powder on his head, nor a
sword by his side. Lettsom responded to his sovereign's
courtesy by presenting him with some rare and
unpurchasable medals.</p>

<p>Though his writings show him to have been an enlightened
physician for his time, his system of practice
was not of course free from the violent measures
which were universally believed in during the last
century. He used to say of himself,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"When patients sick to me apply,<br></span>
<span class="i6">I physics, bleeds and sweats 'em;<br></span>
<span class="i4">Then—if they choose to die,<br></span>
<span class="i0">What's that to me—I lets 'em."—(I. Lettsom.)<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>But his prescriptions were not invariably of a kind
calculated to depress the system of his patient. On
one occasion an old American merchant, who had been
ruined by the rupture between the colonies and the
mother country, requested his attendance and professional
advice. The unfortunate man was seventy-four
years of age, and bowed down with the weight of
his calamities.</p>

<p>"Those trees, doctor," said the sick man, looking
out of his bed-room window over his lawn, "I
planted, and have lived to see some of them too old
to bear fruit; they are part of my family: and my
children, still dearer to me, must quit this residence,
which was the delight of my youth, and the hope of
my old age."</p>

<p>The Quaker physician was deeply affected by these
pathetic words, and the impressive tone with which
they were uttered. He spoke a few words of comfort,
and quitted the room, leaving on the table as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
prescription—a cheque for a large sum of money. Nor
did his goodness end there. He purchased the house
of his patient's creditors, and presented it to him for
life.</p>

<p>As Lettsom was travelling in the neighbourhood of
London, a highwayman stopped his carriage, and,
putting a pistol into the window, demanded him to
surrender his money. The faltering voice and hesitation
of the robber showed that he had only recently
taken to his perilous vocation, and his appearance
showed him to be a young man who had moved in the
gentle ranks of life. Lettsom quickly responded that
he was sorry to see such a well-looking young man
pursuing a course which would inevitably bring him
to ruin; that he would <i>give</i> him freely all the money
he had about him, and would try to put him in a
better way of life, if he liked to call on him in the
course of a few days. As the doctor said this, he
gave his card to the young man, who turned out to
be another victim of the American war. He had only
made one similar attempt on the road before, and
had been driven to lawless action by unexpected
pennilessness. Lettsom endeavoured in vain to procure
aid for his <i>protégé</i> from the commissioners for
relieving the American sufferers; but eventually the
Queen, interested in the young man's case, presented
him with a commission in the army; and in a brief
military career, that was cut short by yellow fever
in the West Indies, he distinguished himself so much
that his name appeared twice in the <i>Gazette</i>.</p>

<p>On one of his benevolent excursions the doctor
found his way into the squalid garret of a poor
woman who had seen better days. With the language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
and deportment of a lady she begged the physician to
give her a prescription. After inquiring carefully
into her case, he wrote on a slip of paper to the overseers
of the parish—</p>

<p>"A shilling per diem for Mrs Moreton. Money,
not physic, will cure her.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Lettsom.</span>"<br>
</p>

<p>Of all Lettsom's numerous works, including his
contributions to the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, under the
signature of "Mottles," the anagram of his own
name, the one most known to the general reader, is
the "History of some of the Effects of Hard Drinking."
It concludes with a scale of Temperance and
Intemperance, in imitation of a thermometer. To
each of the two conditions seventy degrees are allotted.
Against the seventieth (or highest) degree of
Temperance is marked "Water," under which, at
distances of ten degrees, follow "Milk-and-Water,"
"Small Beer," "Cyder and Perry," "Wine," "Porter,"
"Strong Beer." The tenth degree of Intemperance
is "Punch"; the twentieth, "Toddy and
Crank"; the thirtieth, "Grog and Brandy and
Water"; the fortieth, "Flip and Shrub"; the fiftieth,
"Bitters infused in Spirits, Usquebaugh, Hysteric
Water"; the sixtieth, "Gin, Aniseed, Brandy, Rum,
and Whisky," in the morning; the seventieth, like the
sixtieth, only taken day and night. Then follow, in
tabular order, the vices, diseases, and punishments of
the different stages of Intemperance. The mere
enumeration of them ought to keep the most confirmed
toper sober for the rest of his days:—</p>

<p>"<i>Vices.</i>—Idleness, Peevishness, Quarrelling, Fighting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
Lying, Swearing, Obscenity, Swindling, Perjury,
Burglary, Murder, Suicide.</p>

<p>"<i>Diseases.</i>—Sickness, Tremors of the Hands in the
Morning, Bloatedness, Inflamed Eyes, Red Nose and
Face, Sore and Swelled Legs, Jaundice, Pains in the
Limbs, Dropsy, Epilepsy, Melancholy, Madness,
Palsy, Apoplexy, Death.</p>

<p>"<i>Punishments.</i>—Debt, Black Eyes, Rags, Hunger,
Hospital, Poor-house, Jail, Whipping, the Hulks,
Botany Bay, Gallows!"</p>

<p>This reads like Hogarth's Gin Lane.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>A FEW MORE QUACKS.</h3>

<blockquote><p>The term quack is applicable to all who, by pompous pretences,
mean insinuations, and indirect promises, endeavour
to obtain that confidence to which neither education, merit,
nor experience entitles them.—<i>Samuel Parr's Definition.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>Of London's modern quacks, one of the most daring
was James Graham, M. D., of Edinburgh, who introduced
into England the juggleries of Mesmer,
profiting by them in this country scarcely less than
his master did on the Continent. His brother married
Catherine Macaulay, the author of the immortal
History of England, which no one now-a-days reads;
the admired of Horace Walpole; the lady whose statue
during her life-time, was erected in the chancel of the
church of St. Stephen's, Walbrook. Graham's sister
was married to Dr. Arnold, of Leicester, the author
of a valuable book on Insanity.</p>

<p>With a little intellect and more knavery, Dr.
Graham ran a course very similar to Mesmer. Emerging
from obscurity in or about the year 1780, he
established himself in a spacious mansion in the
Royal Terrace, Adelphi, overlooking the Thames, and
midway between the Blackfriars and Westminster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
Bridges. The river front of the house was ornamented
with classic pillars; and inscribed over the
principal entrance, in gilt letters on a white compartment,
was "Templum Æsculapio Sacrum." The
"Temple of Health," as it was usually spoken of in
London, quickly became a place of fashionable resort.
Its spacious rooms were supplied with furniture made
to be stared at—sphynxes, dragons breathing flame,
marble statues, paintings, medico-electric apparatus,
rich curtains and draperies, stained glass windows,
stands of armour, immense pillars and globes of glass,
and remarkably arranged plates of burnished steel.
Luxurious couches were arranged in the recesses of
the apartments, whereon languid visitors were invited
to rest; whilst the senses were fascinated with strains
of gentle music, and the perfumes of spices burnt in
swinging censers. The most sacred shrine of the
edifice stood in the centre of "The Great Apollo
Apartment," described by the magician in the following
terms:—"This room is upwards of thirty feet
long, by twenty wide, and full fifteen feet high in
the ceiling; on entering which, words can convey no
adequate idea of the astonishment and awful
sublimity which seizes the mind of every spectator.
The first object which strikes the eye, astonishes, expands,
and ennobles the soul of the beholder, is a
magnificent temple, sacred to health, and dedicated
to Apollo. In this tremendous edifice are combined
or singly dispensed the irresistible and salubrious influences
of electricity, or the elementary fire, air, and
magnetism; three of the greatest of those agents of
universal principles, which, pervading all created being
and substances that we are acquainted with, connect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
animate, and keep together all nature;—or, in
other words, principles which constitute, as it were, the
various faculties of the material soul of the universe:
<i>the Eternally Supreme Jehovah Himself</i> being the
essential source—the Life of that Life—the Agent of
those Agents—the Soul of that Soul—the All-creating,
all-sustaining, all-blessing God!—not of this
world alone—not of the other still greater worlds
which we know compose our solar system! Not the
creator, the soul, the preserver of this world alone—or
of any of those which we have seen roll with uninterrupted
harmony for so many thousands of years!—not
the God of the millions of myriads of worlds,
of systems, and of various ranks and orders of beings
and intelligences which probably compose the aggregate
of the grand, the vast, the incomprehensible system
of the universe!—but the eternal, infinitely wise,
and infinitely powerful, infinitely good God of the
whole—the Great Sun of the Universe!"</p>

<p>This blasphemy was regarded in Bond Street and
Mayfair as inspired wisdom. It was held to be wicked
not to believe in Dr. Graham. The "Temple" was
crowded with the noble and wealthy; and Graham,
mingling the madness of a religious enthusiast with
the craft of a charlatan, preached to his visitors and
prayed over them with the zeal of Joanna Southcote.
He composed a form of prayer to be used in the Temple,
called "the Christian's Universal Prayer," a
long rigmarole of spasmodic nonsense, to the printed
edition of which the author affixed the following note:
"The first idea of writing this prayer was suggested
by hearing, one evening, the celebrated Mr Fischer
play on the hautboy, with inimitable sweetness, <i>his
long-winded</i> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>variations on some old tunes. I was desirous
to know what effect that would have when extended
to literary composition. I made the experiment
as soon as I got home, on the Lord's Prayer, and
wrote the following in bed, before morning:"</p>

<p>About the "Temple of Health" there are a few
other interesting particulars extant. The woman
who officiated in the "Sanctum Sanctorum" was the
fair and frail Emma—in due course to be the wife of
Sir William Hamilton, and the goddess of Nelson.
The charges for consulting the oracle, or a mere admission
in the Temple, were thus arranged. "The
nobility, gentry, and others, who apply through the
day, viz., from ten to six, must pay a guinea the first
consultation, and half a guinea every time after. No
person whomsoever, even personages of the first rank,
need expect to be attended at their own houses, unless
confined to bed by sickness, or to their room through
extreme weakness; and from those whom he attends
at their houses two guineas each visit is expected.
Dr Graham, for reasons of the highest importance
to the public as well as to himself, has a chymical
laboratory and a great medicinal cabinet in his own
house; and in the above fixed fees either at home or
abroad, every expense attending his advice, medicines,
applications, and operations, and <i>influences</i>,
are included—a few tedious, complex, and expensive
operations in the Great Apollo apartment only excepted."</p>

<p>But the humour of the man culminated when he
bethought himself of displaying the crutches and
spectacles of restored patients, as trophies of his victories
over disease. "Over the doors of the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
rooms, under the vaulted compartments of the
ceiling, and in each side of the centre arches of the
hall, are placed walking-sticks, ear-trumpets, visual
glasses, crutches, &amp;c., left, and here placed as most
honourable trophies, by deaf, weak, paralytic, and
emaciated persons, cripples, &amp;c., who, being cured,
have happily no longer need of such assistances."</p>

<p>Amongst the furniture of the "Temple of Health"
was a celestial bed, provided with costly draperies,
and standing on glass legs. Married couples, who
slept on this couch, were sure of being blessed with a
beautiful progeny. For its use £100 per night was
demanded, and numerous persons of rank were foolish
enough to comply with the terms. Besides his
celestial bed and magnetic tomfooleries, Graham
vended an "Elixir of Life," and subsequently recommended
and superintended earth-bathing. Any one
who took the elixir might live as long as he wished.
For a constant supply of so valuable a medicine,
£1000, paid in advance, was the demand. More than
one nobleman paid that sum. The Duchess of Devonshire
patronized Graham, as she did every other
quack who came in her way; and her folly was countenanced
by Lady Spencer, Lady Clermont, the
Comtesse de Polignac, and the Comtesse de Chalon.</p>

<p>Of all Dr. Graham's numerous writings one of the
most ridiculous is "A clear, full, and faithful Portraiture,
or Description, and ardent Recommendation
of a certain most beautiful and spotless Virgin Princess,
of Imperial descent! To a certain youthful
Heir-Apparent, in the possession of whom alone his
Royal Highness can be truly, permanently, and supremely
happy. Most humbly dedicated to his Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
Highness, George, Prince of Wales, and earnestly
recommended to the attention of the Members of both
Houses of Parliament." When George the Third was
attacked for the first time with mental aberration,
Graham hastened down to Windsor, and obtaining
an interview there with the Prince Regent, with
thrilling earnestness of manner assured his Royal
Highness that he would suffer in the same way as his
father unless he married a particular princess that he
(Dr. Graham) was ready to introduce to him. On
the Prince inquiring the name of the lady, Graham
answered, "Evangelical Wisdom." Possibly the
royal patient would have profited, had he obeyed the
zealot's exhortation. The work, of which we have
just given the title, is a frantic rhapsody on the beauties
and excellence of the Virgin Princess Wisdom,
arranged in chapters and verses, and begins thus:—</p>

<p class="center">"CHAP. 1."</p>

<p>"Hear! all ye people of the earth, and understand;
give ear attentively, O ye kings and princes, and be
admonished; yea, learn attentively, ye who are the
rulers and the judges of the people."</p>

<p>"2. Let the inhabitants of the earth come before
me with all the innocency and docility of little children;
and the kings and governors, with all purity
and simplicity of heart.</p>

<p>"3. For the Holy Spirit of Wisdom! or celestial
discipline! flees from duplicity and deceit, and from
haughtiness and hardness of heart; it removes far
from the thoughts that are without understanding;
and will not abide when unrighteousness cometh in."</p>

<p>The man who was fool enough to write such stuff
as this had, however, some common sense. He detected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the real cause of the maladies of half those
who consulted him, and he did his utmost to remove
it. Like the French quack Villars, he preached up
"abstinence" and "cleanliness." Of the printed
"general instructions" to his patients, No. 2 runs
thus:—"It will be unreasonable for Dr Graham's
patients to expect a complete and lasting cure, or
even great alleviation of their peculiar maladies, unless
they keep their body and limbs most perfectly
clean with frequent washings, breathe fresh open air
day and night, be simple in the quality and moderate
in the quantity of their food and drink, and totally
give up using deadly poisons and weakeners of both
body and soul, and the canker-worms of estates,
called foreign tea and coffee, red port wine, spirituous
liquors, tobacco and snuff, gaming and late
hours, and all sinful and unnatural and excessive
indulgence of the animal appetites, and of the diabolical
and degrading mental passions. On practising
the above rules, and a widely-open window day
and night, and on washing with cold water, and going
to bed every night by eight or nine, and rising by
four or five, depends the very perfection of bodily
and mental health, strength, and happiness."</p>

<p>Many to whom this advice was given thought that
ill-health, which made them unable to enjoy anything
was no worse an evil than health brought on
terms that left them nothing to enjoy. During his
career Graham moved his "Temple of Health" from
the Adelphi to Pall-Mall. But he did not prosper in
the long-run. His religious extravagances for a while
brought him adherents, but when they took the form
of attacking the Established Church, they brought on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
him an army of adversaries. He came also into humiliating
collision with the Edinburgh authorities.</p>

<p>Perhaps the curative means employed by Graham
were as justifiable and beneficial as the remedies of
the celebrated doctors of Whitworth in Yorkshire,
the brothers Taylor. These gentlemen were farriers,
by profession, but condescended to prescribe for their
own race as well, always, however, regarding the
vocation of brute-doctor as superior in dignity to
that of a physician. Their system of practice was a
vigorous one. They made no gradual and insidious
advances on disease, but opened against it a bombardment
of shot and shell from all directions. They
bled their patients by the gallon, and drugged them
by the stone. Their druggists, Ewbank and Wallis
of York, used to supply them with a ton of Glauber's
salts at a time. In their dispensary scales and
weights were regarded as the bugbears of ignoble
minds. Every Sunday morning they bled <i>gratis</i> any
one who liked to demand a prick from their lancets.
Often a hundred poor people were seated on the surgery
benches at the same time, waiting for venesection.
When each of the party had found a seat the
two brothers passed rapidly along the lines of bared
arms, the one doctor deftly applying the ligature
above the elbow, and the other immediately opening
the vein, the crimson stream from which was directed
to a wooden trough that ran round the apartment
in which the operations were performed. The same
magnificence of proportion characterized their administration
of kitchen physic. If they ordered a
patient broth, they directed his nurse to buy a large
leg of mutton, and boil it in a copper of water down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
to a strong decoction, of which a quart should be
administered at stated intervals.</p>

<p>When the little Abbé de Voisenon was ordered by
his physician to drink a quart of ptisan per hour he
was horrified. On his next visit the doctor asked,</p>

<p>"What effect has the ptisan produced?"</p>

<p>"Not any," answered the little Abbé.</p>

<p>"Have you taken it all?"</p>

<p>"I could not take more than half of it."</p>

<p>The physician was annoyed, even angry that his
directions had not been carried out, and frankly said
so.</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, my friend</i>," pleaded the Abbé, "<i>how could
you desire me to swallow a quart an hour?—I hold
but a pint!</i>"</p>

<p>This reminds us of a story we have heard told of an
irascible physician who died, after attaining a venerable
age, at the close of the last century. The story
is one of those which, told once, are told many times,
and affixed to new personages, according to the
whim or ignorance of the narrator.</p>

<p>"Your husband is very ill—very ill—high fever,"
observed the Doctor to the poor labourer's wife;
"and he's old, worn, emaciated: his hand is as dry as
a Suffolk cheese. You must keep giving him water—as
much as he'll drink; and, as I am coming back
to-night from Woodbridge, I'll see him again. There—don't
come snivelling about me!—my heart is a
deuced deal too hard to stand that sort of thing.
But, since you want something to cry about, just listen—your
husband <i>isn't going to die yet</i>! There,
now you're disappointed. Well, you brought it on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
yourself. Mind lots of water—as much as he'll
drink"</p>

<p>The doctor was ashamed of the feminine tenderness
of his heart, and tried to hide it under an affectation
of cynicism, and a manner at times verging on
brutality. Heaven bless all his descendants, scattered
over the whole world, but all of them brave
and virtuous! A volume might be written on his
good qualities; his only bad one being extreme irascibility.
His furies were many, and sprung from
divers visitations; but nothing was so sure to lash
him into a tempest as to be pestered with idle questions.</p>

<p>"Water, sir?" whined Molly Meagrim. "To be
sure, your honour—water he shall have, poor dear
soul! But, your honour, how much water ought I
to give him?"</p>

<p>"Zounds, woman! haven't I told you to give him
as much as he'll take?—and you ask me how much!
<i>How much?</i>—give him a couple of pails of water, if
he'll take 'em. Now, do you hear me, you old fool?
Give him a couple of pails."</p>

<p>"The Lord bless your honour—yes," whined
Molly.</p>

<p>To get beyond the reach of her miserable voice the
Doctor ran to his horse, and rode off to Woodbridge.
At night as he returned, he stopped at the cottage
to inquire after the sick man.</p>

<p>"He's bin took away, yer honour," said the woman,
as the physician entered. "The water didn't
fare to do him noan good—noan in the lessest, sir.
Only then we couldn't get down the right quantity,
though we did our best. We got down better nor a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
pail and a half, when he slipped out o' our hands.
Ah, yer honour! if we could but ha' got him to swaller
the rest, he might still be alive! But we did our
best, Doctor!"</p>

<p>Clumsy empirics, however, as the Taylors were,
they attended people of the first importance. The
elder Taylor was called to London to attend Thurlow,
Bishop of Durham, the brother of Lord Chancellor
Thurlow. The representative men of the Faculty
received him at the bishop's residence, but he
would not commence the consultation till the arrival
of John Hunter. "I won't say a word till Jack Hunter
comes," roared the Whitworth doctor; "he's the
only man of you who knows anything." When Hunter
arrived, Taylor proceeded to his examination of
the bishop's state, and, in the course of it, used some
ointment which he took from a box.</p>

<p>"What's it made of?" Hunter asked.</p>

<p>"That's not a fair question," said Taylor, turning
to the Lord Chancellor, who happened to be present.
"No, no, Jack. I'll send you as much as you please,
but I won't tell you what it's made of."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>ST. JOHN LONG.</h3>


<p>In the entire history of charlatanism, however, it
would be difficult to point to a career more extraordinary
than the brilliant though brief one of St. John
Long, in our own cultivated London, at a time scarcely
more than a generation distant from the present.
Though a pretender, and consummate quack, he was
distinguished from the vulgar herd of cheats by the
possession of enviable personal endowments, a good
address, and a considerable quantity of intellect.
The son of an Irish basket-maker, he was born in or
near Doneraile, and in his boyhood assisted in his
father's humble business. His artistic talents, which
he cultivated for some time without the aid of a
drawing-master, enabled him, while still quite a lad,
to discontinue working as a rush-weaver. For a little
while he stayed at Dublin, and had some intercourse
with Daniel Richardson the painter; after
which he moved to Limerick county, and started on
his own account as a portrait-painter, and an instructor
in the use of the brush. That his education
was not superior to what might be expected in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
clever youth of such lowly extraction, the following
advertisement, copied from a Limerick paper of February
10, 1821, attests:—</p>

<p>"Mr John Saint John Long, Historical and Portrait
Painter, the only pupil of Daniel Richardson,
Esq., late of Dublin, proposes, during his stay in
Limerick, to take portraits from Ittalian Head to
whole length; and parson desirous of getting theirs
done, in historical, hunting, shooting, fishing, or any
other character; or their family, grouped in one or
two paintings from life-size to miniature, so as to
make an historical subject, choseing one from history."</p>

<p>"The costume of the period from whence it would
be taken will be particularly attended to, and the
character of each proserved."</p>

<p>"He would take views in the country, terms per
agreement. Specimens to be seen at his Residence,
No. 116, Georges Street, opposite the Club-house, and
at Mr James Dodds, Paper-staining Warehouse,
Georges Street.</p>

<p>"Mr Long is advised by his several friends to give
instructions in the Art of Painting in Oils, Opeak,
Chalk, and Water-colours, &amp;c., to a limited number
of Pupils of Respectability two days in each week
at stated hours."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen are not to attend at the same hour
the Ladies attend at. He will supply them in water-colours,
&amp;c."</p>

<p>How the young artist acquired the name of St.
John is a mystery. When he blazed into notoriety,
his admirers asserted that it came to him in company
with noble blood that ran in his veins; but more unkind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
observers declared that it was assumed, as being
likely to tickle the ears of his credulous adherents.
His success as a provincial art-professor was considerable.
The gentry of Limerick liked his manly bearing
and lively conversation, and invited him to their
houses to take likenesses of their wives, flirt with
their daughters, and accompany their sons on hunting
and shooting excursions. Emboldened by good
luck in his own country, and possibly finding the
patronage of the impoverished aristocracy of an Irish
province did not yield him a sufficient income, he
determined to try his fortune in England. Acting
on this resolve, he hastened to London, and with ingratiating
manners and that persuasive tongue which
nine Irishmen out of ten possess, he managed to get
introductions to a few respectable drawing-rooms.
He even obtained some employment from Sir Thomas
Lawrence, as colour-grinder and useful assistant in
the studio; and was elected a member of the Royal
Society of Literature, and also of the Royal Asiatic
Society. But like many an Irish adventurer, before
and after him, he found it hard work to live on his
impudence, pleasant manners, and slender professional
acquirements. He was glad to colour anatomical
drawings for the professors and pupils of one
of the minor surgical schools of London; and in
doing so picked up a few pounds and a very slight
knowledge of the structure of the human frame.
The information so obtained stimulated him to further
researches, and, ere a few more months of starvation
had passed over, he deemed himself qualified
to cure all the bodily ailments to which the children
of Adam are subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>He invented a lotion or liniment endowed with the
remarkable faculty of distinguishing between sound
and unsound tissues. To a healthy part it was as
innocuous as water; but when applied to a surface
under which any seeds of disease were lurking, it
became a violent irritant, creating a sore over the
seat of mischief, and stimulating nature to throw
off the morbid virus. He also instructed his patients
to inhale the vapour which rose from a certain mixture
compounded by him in large quantities, and
placed in the interior of a large mahogany case,
which very much resembled an upright piano. In
the sides of this piece of furniture were apertures,
into which pipe-stalks were screwed for the benefit
of afflicted mortals, who, sitting on easy lounges,
smoked away like a party of Turkish elders.</p>

<p>With these two agents St. John Long engaged to
combat every form of disease—gout, palsy, obstructions
of the liver, cutaneous affections; but the malady
which he professed to have the most complete
command over was consumption. His success in surrounding
himself with patients was equal to his audacity.
He took a large house in Harley Street, and
fitted it up for the reception of people anxious to
consult him; and for some seasons every morning
and afternoon (from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.) the public
way was blocked up with carriages pressing to his
door. The old and the young alike flocked to him;
but nine of his patients out of every ten were ladies.
For awhile the foolish of every rank in London
seemed to have but one form in which to display
their folly. Needy matrons from obscure suburban
villages came with their guineas to consult the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
oracle; and ladies of the highest rank, fashion, and
wealth, hastened to place themselves and their daughters
at the mercy of a pretender's ignorance.</p>

<p>Unparalleled were the scenes which the reception-rooms
of that notorious house in Harley Street witnessed.
In one room were two enormous inhalers,
with flexible tubes running outwards in all directions,
and surrounded by dozens of excited women—ladies
of advanced years, and young girls giddy with the
excitement of their first London season—puffing
from their lips the medicated vapour, or waiting till
a mouth-piece should be at liberty for their pink
lips. In another room the great magician received
his patients. Some he ordered to persevere in inhalation,
others he divested of their raiment, and rubbed
his miraculous liniment into their backs, between
their shoulders or over their bosoms. Strange to say,
these lavations and frictions—which invariably took
place in the presence of third persons, nurses or invalids—had
very different results. The fluid, which,
as far as the eye could discern, was taken out of the
same vessel, and was the same for all, would instantaneously
produce on one lady a burning excoriation,
which had in due course to be dressed with cabbage-leaves;
but on another would be so powerless that she
could wash in it, or drink it copiously, like ordinary
pump-water, with impunity. "Yes," said the wizard,
"that was his system, and such were its effects.
If a girl had tubercles in her lungs, the lotion applied
to the outward surface of her chest would produce
a sore, and extract the virus from the organs of respiration.
If a gentleman had a gouty foot, and
washed it in this new water of Jordan, at the cost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
of a little temporary irritation the vicious particles
would leave the affected part. But on any sound
person who bathed in it the fluid would have no
power whatever."</p>

<p>The news of the wonderful remedy flew to every
part of the kingdom; and from every quarter sick
persons, wearied of a vain search after an alleviation
of their sufferings, flocked to London with hope renewed
once more. St. John Long had so many applicants
for attention that he was literally unable to
give heed to all of them; and he availed himself of
this excess of business to select for treatment those
cases only where there seemed every chance of a satisfactory
result. In this he was perfectly candid,
for time after time he declared that he would take no
one under his care who seemed to have already gone
beyond hope. On one occasion he was called into the
country to see a gentleman who was in the last stage
of consumption; and after a brief examination of
the poor fellow's condition, he said frankly—</p>

<p>"Sir, you are so ill that I cannot take you under
my charge at present. You want stamina. Take
hearty meals of beefsteaks and strong beer; and if
you are better in ten days, I'll do my best for you
and cure you."</p>

<p>It was a safe offer to make, for the sick man lived
little more than forty-eight hours longer.</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding the calls of his enormous
practice, St. John Long found time to enjoy himself.
He went a great deal into fashionable society, and
was petted by the great and high-born, not only because
he was a notoriety, but because of his easy
manners, imposing carriage, musical though hesitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
voice, and agreeable disposition. He was tall
and slight, but strongly built; and his countenance,
thin and firmly set, although frank in expression,
caused beholders to think highly of his intellectual
refinement, as well as of his decision and energy.
Possibly his personal advantages had no slight influence
with his feminine applauders. But he possessed
other qualities yet more fitted to secure their esteem—an
Irish impetuosity of temperament and a sincere
sympathy with the unfortunate. He was an
excellent horseman, hunting regularly, and riding
superb horses. On one occasion, as he was cantering
round the Park, he saw a man strike a woman, and
without an instant's consideration he pulled up,
leaped to the ground, seized the fellow bodily, and
with one enormous effort flung him slap over the
Park rails.</p>

<p>But horse-exercise was the only masculine pastime
he was very fond of. He was very temperate in his
habits; and although Irish gentlemen <i>used</i> to get
tipsy, he never did. Painting, music, and the society
of a few really superior women, were the principal
sources of enjoyment to which this brilliant charlatan
had recourse in his leisure hours. Many were
the ladies of rank and girls of gentle houses who
would have gladly linked their fortunes to him and
his ten thousand a year.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/40161/40161-h/40161-h.htm#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> But though numerous matrimonial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
overtures were made to him, he persevered
in his bachelor style of life; and although he was
received with peculiar intimacy into the privacy of
female society, scandal never even charged him with
a want of honour or delicacy towards women, apart
from his quackery. Indeed, he broke off his professional
connection with one notorious lady of rank,
rather than gratify her eccentric wish to have her
likeness taken by him in that remarkable costume—or
no costume at all—in which she was wont to receive
her visitors.</p>

<p>In the exercise of his art he treated women unscrupulously.
Amidst the crowd of ladies who thronged
his reception-rooms he moved, smiling, courteous,
and watchful, listening to their mutual confidences
about their maladies, the constitutions of their relations,
and their family interests. Every stray sentence
the wily man caught up and retained in his
memory, for future use. To induce those to become
his patients who had nothing the matter with them,
and consequently would go to swell the list of his
successful cases, he used the most atrocious artifices.</p>

<p>"Ah, Lady Emily, I saw your dear sister," he
would say to a patient, "yesterday—driving in the
Park—lovely creature she is! Ah, poor thing!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>"Poor thing, Mr. Long!—why, Catherine is the
picture of health!"</p>

<p>"Ah," the adroit fellow would answer, sadly, "you
think so—so does she—and so does every one besides
myself who sees her; but—but—unless prompt remedial
measures are taken that dear girl, ere two
short years have flown, will be in her grave." This
mournful prophecy would be speedily conveyed to
Catherine's ears; and, under the influence of that
nervous dread of death which almost invariably torments
the youthful and healthy, she would implore
the great physician to save her from her doom. It
was not difficult to quiet her anxious heart. Attendance
at 41, Harley Street, for six weeks, during
which time a sore was created on her breast by the
corrosive liniment, and cured by the application of
cabbage-leaves and nature's kindly processes, enabled
her to go out once more into the world, sounding
her saviour's praises, and convinced that she might
all her life long expose herself to the most trying
changes of atmosphere, without incurring any risk
of chest-affection.</p>

<p>But Mr. Long had not calculated that, although
nine hundred and ninety-nine constitutions out of
every thousand would not be materially injured by
his treatment, he would at rare intervals meet with
a patient of delicate organization, on whom the application
of his blistering fluid would be followed by
the most serious consequences. In the summer of the
year 1830, two young ladies, of a good Irish family,
named Cashin, came to London, and were inveigled
into the wizard's net. They were sisters; and the
younger of them, being in delicate health, called on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Mr. Long, accompanied by her elder sister. The ordinary
course of inhalation and rubbing was prescribed
for the invalid; and ere long, frightened by
the quack's prediction that, unless she was subjected
to immediate treatment, she would fall into a rapid
consumption, the other young lady submitted to have
the corrosive lotion rubbed over her back and shoulders.
The operation was performed on the 3rd of August.
Forthwith a violent inflammation was established:
the wound, instead of healing, became daily
and hourly of a darker and more unhealthy aspect;
unable to bear the cabbage-leaves on the raw and
suppurating surface, the sufferer induced her nurse
to apply a comforting poultice to the part, but no
relief was obtained from it. St. John Long was sent
for, and the 14th (just eleven days after the exhibition
of the corrosive liniment), he found his victim
in a condition of extreme exhaustion and pain, and
suffering from continued sickness. Taking these
symptoms as a mere matter of course, he ordered her
a tumbler of mulled wine, and took his departure.
On the following day (Sunday, 15th) he called again,
and offered to dress the wound. But the poor girl,
suddenly waking up to the peril of her position,
would not permit him to touch her, and, raising herself
with an effort in her bed, exclaimed—</p>

<p>"Indeed, Mr. Long, you shall not touch my back
again—you very well know that when I became your
patient I was in perfect health, but now you are killing
me!" Without losing his self-command at this
pathetic appeal, he looked into her earnest eyes, and
said, impressively—</p>

<p>"Whatever inconvenience you are now suffering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
it will be of short duration, for in two or three days
you will be in better health than you ever were in
your life."</p>

<p>But his words did not restore her confidence. The
next day (the 16th) Mr., now Sir Benjamin, Brodie
was sent for, and found on the wretched girl's back
an inflamed surface about the size of a plate, having
in the centre a spot as large as the palm of his hand,
which was in a state of mortification. The time for
rescue was past. Sir Benjamin prescribed a saline
draught to allay the sickness; and within twenty-four
hours Catherine Cashin, who a fortnight before
had been in perfect health and high spirits—an unusually
lovely girl, in her 25th year—lay upon her
bed in the quiet of death.</p>

<p>An uproar immediately ensued; and there was an
almost universal cry from the intelligent people of
the country, that the empiric should be punished.
A coroner's inquest was held; and, in spite of the
efforts made by the charlatan's fashionable adherents,
a verdict was obtained from the jury of man-slaughter
against St. John Long. Every attempt
was made by a set of influential persons of high
rank to prevent the law from taking its ordinary
course. The issue of the warrant for the apprehension
of the offender was most mysteriously and scandalously
delayed: and had it not been for the energy
of Mr. Wakley, who, in a long and useful career of
public service, has earned for himself much undeserved
obloquy, the affair would, even after the verdict
of the coroner's jury, have been hushed up.
Eventually, however, on Saturday, October 30, St.
John Long was placed in the dock of old Bailey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
charged with the manslaughter of Miss Cashin. Instead
of deserting him in his hour of need, his admirers—male
and female—presented themselves at
the Central Criminal Court, to encourage him by
their sympathy, and to give evidence in his favour.
The carriages of distinguished members of the nobility
brought fair freights of the first fashion of
May-fair down to the gloomy court-house that adjoins
Newgate; and belles of the first fashion sat all
through the day in the stifling atmosphere of a
crowded court, looking languishingly at their hero
in the dock, who, from behind his barrier of rue and
fennel, distributed to them smiles of grateful recognition.
The Judge (Mr. Justice Park) manifested
throughout the trial a strong partisanship with the
prisoner; and the Marchioness of Ormond, who was
accommodated with a seat on the bench by his Lordship's
side, conversed with him in whispers during
the proceedings. The summing up was strongly in
favour of the accused; but, in spite of the partial
judge, and an array of fashionable witnesses in favour
of the prisoner, the jury returned a verdict of
guilty.</p>

<p>As it was late on Saturday when the verdict was
given, the judge deferred passing sentence till the
following Monday. At the opening of the court on
that day a yet greater crush of the <i>beau monde</i> was
present; and the judge, instead of awarding a term
of imprisonment to the guilty man, condemned him
merely to pay a fine of £250, or to be imprisoned till
such fine was paid. Mr. St. John Long immediately
took a roll of notes from his pocket, paid the mulct,
and leaving the court with his triumphant friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
accepted a seat in Lord Sligo's curricle, and drove
to the west end of the town.</p>

<p>The scandalous sentence was a fit conclusion to the
absurd scenes which took place in the court of the
Old Bailey, and at the coroner's inquest. At one or
the other of these inquiries the witnesses advanced
thousands of outrageous statements, of which the
following may be taken as a fair specimen:—</p>

<p>One young lady gave evidence that she had been
cured of consumption by Mr. Long's liniment; she
knew she had been so cured, because she had a very
bad cough, and, after the rubbing in all the ointment,
the cough went away. An old gentleman testified
that he had for years suffered from attacks of the
gout, at intervals of from one to three months; he
was convinced Mr. Long had cured him, because he
had been free from gout for five weeks. Another
gentleman had been tortured with headache; Mr.
Long applied his lotion to it—the humour which
caused his headache came away in a clear limpid
discharge. A third gentleman affirmed that Mr.
Long's liniment had reduced a dislocation of his
child's hip-joint. The Marchioness of Ormond, on
oath, stated that she <i>knew</i> that Miss Cashin's back
was rubbed with the same fluid as she and her daughters
had used to wash their hands with; but she admitted
that she neither <i>saw</i> the back rubbed, nor <i>saw</i>
the fluid with which it was rubbed taken from the
bottle. Sir Francis Burdett also bore testimony to
the harmlessness of Mr. Long's system of practice.
Mr. Wakley, in the <i>Lancet</i>, asserted that Sir Francis
Burdett had called on Long to ask him if his liniment
would give the Marquis of Anglesea a leg, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
place of the one he lost at Waterloo, if it were applied
to the stump. Long gave an encouraging answer;
and the lotion was applied, with the result of
producing not an entire foot and leg—but a great
toe!</p>

<p>Miss Cashin's death was quickly followed by another
fatal case. A Mrs. Lloyd died from the effects
of the corrosive lotion; and again a coroner's jury
found St. John Long guilty of manslaughter, and
again he was tried at the Old Bailey—but this second
trial terminated in his acquital.</p>

<p>It seems scarcely creditable, and yet it is true, that
these exposures did not have the effect of lessening
his popularity. The respectable organs of the Press—the
<i>Times</i>, the <i>Chronicle</i>, the <i>Herald</i>, the <i>John
Bull</i>, the <i>Lancet</i>, the <i>Examiner</i>, the <i>Spectator</i>, the
<i>Standard</i>, the <i>Globe</i>, <i>Blackwood</i>, and <i>Fraser</i>, combined
in doing their best to render him contemptible
in the eyes of his supporters. But all their efforts
were in vain. His old dupes remained staunch adherents
to him, and every day brought fresh converts
to their body. With unabashed front he went everywhere,
proclaiming himself a martyr in the cause of
humanity, and comparing his evil treatment to the
persecutions that Galileo, Harvey, Jenner, and Hunter
underwent at the hands of the prejudiced and
ignorant. Instead of uncomplainingly taking the
lashes of satirical writers, he first endeavored to bully
them into silence, and swaggering into newspaper
and magazine offices asked astonished editors how
they <i>dared</i> to call him a <i>quack</i>. Finding, however,
that this line of procedure would not improve his
position, he wrote his defence, and published it in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
octavo volume, together with numerous testimonials
of his worth from grateful patients, and also a letter
of cordial support from Dr. Ramadge, M.D., Oxon.,
a fellow of the College of Physicians. In a ridiculous
and ungrammatical epistle, defending this pernicious
quack, who had been convicted of manslaughter,
Dr. Ramadge displayed not less anxiety to
blacken the reputation of his own profession, than
he did to clear the fame of the charlatan whom he
designated "<i>a guiltless and a cruelly persecuted individual!!!</i>"
The book itself is one of the most interesting
to be found in quack literature. On the
title-page is a motto from Pope—"No man deserves
a monument who could not be wrapped in a winding-sheet
of papers written against him"; and amongst
pages of jargon about humoral pathology, it contains
confident predictions that if his victims had <i>continued</i>
in his system, they would have lived. The author
accuses the most eminent surgeons and physicians of
his time of gross ignorance, and of having conspired
together to crush him, because they were jealous of
his success and envious of his income. He even suggests
that the same saline draught, prescribed by Sir
Benjamin Brodie, killed Miss Cashin. Amongst
those whose testimonials appear in the body of the
work are the <i>then</i> Lord Ingestre (his enthusiastic
supporter), Dr. Macartney, the Marchioness of Ormond,
Lady Harriet Kavanagh, the Countess of
Buckinghamshire, and the Marquis of Sligo. The
Marchioness of Ormond testifies how Mr. Long had
miraculously cured her and her daughter of "headaches,"
and her youngest children of "smart attacks
of feverish colds, one with inflammatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
sore throat, the others with more serious bad symptoms."
The Countess of Buckinghamshire says she
is cured of "headache and lassitude"; and Lord
Ingestre avows his belief that Mr. Long's system is
"preventive of disease," because he himself is much
less liable to catch cold than he was before trying it.</p>

<p>Numerous pamphlets also were written in defence
of John St. John Long, Esq., M.R.S.L., and M.R.A.S.
An anonymous author (calling himself a graduate
of Trinity College, Cambridge, and Member of the
Middle Temple), in a tract dated 1831, does not hesitate
to compare the object of his eulogy with the
author of Christianity. "But who can wonder at
Mr Long's persecutions? The brightest character
that ever stept was persecuted, even unto death!
His cures were all perverted, but they were not the
less complete; they were miraculous, but they were
not the less certain!"</p>

<p>To the last St. John Long retained his practice; but
death removed him from the scene of his triumphs
while he was still a young man. The very malady,
his control over which he had so loudly proclaimed,
brought his career—in which knavery or self-delusion,
doubtless both, played a part—to an end. He
died of consumption, at the age of thirty-seven years.
Even in the grave his patients honoured him, for
they erected an elegant and costly monument to his
memory, and adorned it with the following inscription.</p>

<p class="center">
"It is the fate of most men<br>
To have many enemies, and few friends.<br>
This monumental pile<br>
Is not intended to mark the career,<br>
But to shew<br>
How much its inhabitant was respected<br>
By those who knew his worth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span><br>
And the benefits<br>
Derived from his remedial discovery.<br>
He is now at rest,<br>
And far beyond the praises or censures<br>
Of this world.<br>
Stranger, as you respect the receptacle of the dead<br>
(As one of the many who will rest here),<br>
Read the name of<br>
John Saint John Long<br>
without comment."
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the exquisite drollery of this inscription,
in speaking of a plebeian quack-doctor
(who, by the exercise of empiricism, raised himself
to the possession of £5000 per annum, and the intimate
friendship of numbers of the aristocracy) as
the victim of "many enemies and few friends," it
cannot be said to be open to much censure. Indeed,
St. John Long's worshippers were for the most part
of that social grade in which bad taste is rare, though
weakness of understanding possibly may not be uncommon.</p>

<p>The sepulchre itself is a graceful structure, and
occupies a prominent position in the Kensal Green
cemetery, by the side of the principal carriage-way,
leading from the entrance-gate to the chapel of the
burial-ground. Immediately opposite to it, on the
other side of the gravel drive, stands, not inappropriately,
the flaunting sepulchre of Andrew Ducrow,
the horse-rider, "whose death," the inscription informs
us, "deprived the arts and sciences of an eminent
professor and liberal patron." When any
cockney bard shall feel himself inspired to write an
elegy on the west-end grave-yard, he will not omit
to compare John St. John Long's tomb with that of
"the liberal patron of the arts and sciences," and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
also with the cumbrous heap of masonry which covers
the ashes of Dr. Morrison, hygeist, which learned
word, being interpreted, means "the inventor of
Morrison's pills."</p>

<p>To give a finishing touch to the memoir of this
celebrated charlatan, it may be added that after his
death his property became the subject of tedious litigation;
and amongst the claimants upon it was a
woman advanced in years, and of an address and
style that proved her to belong to a very humble
state of life. This woman turned out to be St. John
Long's wife. He had married her when quite a lad,
had found it impossible to live with her, and consequently
had induced her to consent to an amicable
separation. This discovery was a source of great
surprise, and also of enlightenment to the numerous
high-born and richly-endowed ladies who had made
overtures of marriage to the idolized quack, and,
much to their surprise, had had their advances adroitly
but firmly declined.</p>

<p>There are yet to be found in English society, ladies—not
silly, frivolous women, but some of those on
whom the world of intellect has put the stamp of its
approval—who cherish such tender reminiscences of
St. John Long, that they cannot mention his name
without their eyes becoming bright with tears. Of
course this proves nothing, save the credulity and
fond infatuation of the fair ones who love. The
hands of women decked Nero's tomb with flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>THE QUARRELS OF PHYSICIANS.</h3>


<p>For many a day authors have had the reputation
of being more sensitive and quarrelsome than any
other set of men. Truth to tell, they are not always
so amiable and brilliant as their works. There is
in them the national churlishness inducing them to
nurse a contempt for every one they don't personally
know, and a spirit of antagonism towards nearly
every one they do. But to say this is only to say that
they are made of British oak. Unfortunately, however,
they carry on their contentions in a manner
that gives them a wide publicity and a troublesome
duration of fame. Soldiers, when they quarrelled
in the last century, shot one another like gentlemen,
at two paces' distance, and with the crack of their
pistols the whole noise of the matter ceased. Authors,
from time immemorial, have in their angry moments
rushed into print, and lashed their adversaries
with satire, rendered permanent by aid of the
printer's devil,—thus letting posterity know all the
secrets of their folly, whilst the merciful grave put
an end to all memorial of the extravagances of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
friends. There was less love between Radcliffe and
Hannes, Freind and Blackmore, Gibbons and Garth,
than between Pope and Dennis, Swift and Grub
Street. But we know all about the squabbles of the
writers from their poems; whereas only a vague tradition,
in the form of questionable anecdotes, has
come down to us of the animosities of the doctors—a
tradition which would long ere this have died out,
had not Garth—author as well as physician—written
the "Dispensary," and a host of dirty little apothecaries
contracted a habit of scribbling lampoons
about their professional superiors.</p>

<p>Luckily for the members of it, the Faculty of Medicine
is singularly barren of biographies. The career
of a physician is so essentially one of confidence,
that even were he to keep a memorial of its interesting
occurrences, his son wouldn't dare to sell it to
a publisher as the "Revelations of a Departed Physician."
Long ere it would be decent or safe to print
such a diary, the public would have ceased to take
an interest in the writer. Pettigrew's "Life of Lettsom,"
and Macilwain's "Memoirs of Abernethy,"
are almost the only two passable biographies of eminent
medical practitioners in the English language;
and the last of these does not presume to enter fully
on the social relations of the great surgeon. The
lives of Hunter and Jenner are meagre and unworthily
executed, and of Bransby Cooper's Life of
his uncle little can be said that is not in the language
of emphatic condemnation.</p>

<p>From this absence of biographical literature the
medical profession at least derives this advantage—the
world at large knows comparatively little of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
petty feuds and internal differences than it would
otherwise.</p>

<p>The few memorials, however, that we have of the
quarrels of physicians are of a kind that makes us
wish we had more. Of the great battle of the apothecaries
with the physicians we have already spoken
in the notice of Sir Samuel Garth. To those who
are ignorant of human nature it may appear incredible
that a body, so lovingly united against common
foes, should have warred amongst themselves. Yet
such was the case. A London druggist once put up
at the chief inn of a provincial capital, whither he
had come in the course of his annual summer ride.
The good man thought it would hurt neither his
health nor his interests to give "a little supper" to
the apothecaries of the town with whom he was in the
habit of doing business. Under the influence of this
feeling he sallied out from "The White Horse," and
spent a few hours in calling on his friends—asking
for orders and delivering invitations. On returning
to his inn, he ordered a supper for twelve—as eleven
medical gentlemen had engaged to sup with him.
When the hour appointed for the repast was at hand,
a knock at the door was followed by the appearance
of guest A, with a smile of intense benevolence and
enjoyment. Another rap—and guest B entered. A
looked blank—every trace of happiness suddenly
vanishing from his face. B stared at A, as much as
to say, "You be ——!" A shuffled with his feet,
rose, made an apology to his host for leaving the
room to attend to a little matter, and disappeared.
Another rap—and C made his bow of greeting. "I'll
try to be back in five minutes, but if I'm not, don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
wait for me," cried B, hurriedly seizing his hat and
rushing from the apartment. C, a cold-blooded,
phlegmatic man, sat down unconcernedly, and was
a picture of sleeping contentment till the entry of
D, when his hair stood on end, and he fled into the
inn-yard, as if he were pursued by a hyena. E
knocked and said, "How d' you do?" D sprung
from his chair, and shouted, "Good-bye!" And so
it went on till, on guest No. 11 joining the party—that
had received so many new comers, and yet never
for an instant numbered more than three—No. 10
jumped through the window, and ran down the street
to the bosom of his family. The hospitable druggist
and No. 11 found, on a table provided for twelve,
quite as much supper as they required.</p>

<p>Next morning the druggist called on A for an explanation
of his conduct. "Sir," was the answer,
"I could not stop in the same room with such a
scoundrel as B." So it went straight down the line.
B had vowed never to exchange words with C. C
would be shot rather than sit at the same table with
such a scoundrel as D.</p>

<p>"You gentlemen," observed the druggist, with a
smile to each, "seem to be almost as well disposed
amongst yourselves as your brethren in London;
only they, when they meet, don't run from each
other, but draw up, square their elbows, and fight
like men."</p>

<p>The duel between Mead and Woodward, as it is
more particularly mentioned in another part of these
volumes, we need here only to allude to. The contest
between Cheyne and Wynter was of a less bloody
character. Cheyne was a Bath physician, of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
practice and yet greater popularity—dying in 1743,
at the age of seventy-two. At one time of his life
he was so prodigiously fat that he weighed 32 stone,
he and a gentleman named Tantley being the two
stoutest men in Somersetshire. One day, after dinner,
the former asked the latter what he was thinking
about.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," answered Tantley, "how it will
be possible to get either you or me into the grave
after we die."</p>

<p>Cheyne was nettled, and retorted, "Six or eight
stout fellows will do the business for me, but you
must be taken at twice."</p>

<p>Cheyne was a sensible man, and had more than one
rough passage of arms with Beau Nash, when the
beau was dictator of the pump-room. Nash called
the doctor in and asked him to prescribe for him.
The next day, when the physician called and inquired
if his prescription had been followed, the
beau languidly replied:—</p>

<p>"No, i' faith, doctor, I haven't followed it. 'Pon
honour, if I had I should have broken my neck, for
I threw it out of my bed-room window."</p>

<p>But Cheyne had wit enough to reward the inventor
of the white hat for this piece of insolence. One
day he and some of his learned friends were enjoying
themselves over the bottle, laughing with a heartiness
unseemly in philosophers, when, seeing the beau
draw near, the doctor said:—</p>

<p>"Hush, we must be grave now, here's a fool coming
our way."</p>

<p>Cheyne became ashamed of his obesity, and earnestly
set about overcoming it. He brought himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
down by degrees to a moderate diet, and took daily
a large amount of exercise. The result was that he
reduced himself to under eleven stone, and, instead
of injuring his constitution, found himself in the
enjoyment of better health. Impressed with the value
of the discovery he had made, he wrote a book urging
all people afflicted with chronic maladies to imitate
him and try the effects of temperance. Doctors, notwithstanding
their precepts in favour of moderation,
neither are, nor ever have been, averse to the pleasures
of the table. Many of them warmly resented
Cheyne's endeavours to bring good living into disrepute,
possibly deeming that their interests were
attacked not less than their habits. Dryden wrote,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"The first physicians by debauch were made.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Excess began, and sloth sustained the trade;<br></span>
<span class="i0">By chase our long-liv'd fathers earned their food,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Toil strung their nerves and purified their blood;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But we, their sons, a pamper'd race of men,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Are dwindled down to threescore years and ten.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Better to hunt in fields for health unbought,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than fee the doctor for a nauseous draught;<br></span>
<span class="i0">The wise for cure on exercise depend,<br></span>
<span class="i0">God never made his work for man to mend."</span>
</div>

<p>Dr. Wynter arose to dispose of Cheyne in a summary
fashion. Wynter had two good reasons for
hating Cheyne: Wynter was an Englishman and
loved wine, Cheyne was a Scotchman and loved
milk.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Wynter to Dr. Cheyne.</span></p>

<span class="i0">Eat grass, reduce thyself, and die,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Thy patients then may live."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Cheyne responded, with more wit and more good
manners, in the following fashion:—</p>

<p class="center">"<span class="smcap">Dr. Cheyne to Dr. Wynter.</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The concluding two lines of Cheyne's answer were
doubtless little to the taste of his unsuccessful opponent.</p>

<p>In their contentions physicians have not often had
recourse to the duel. With them an appeal to arms
has rarely been resorted to, but when it has been deliberately
made the combatants have usually fought
with decision. The few duels fought between women
have for the most part been characterized by American
ferocity. Madame Dunoyer mentions a case of
a duel with swords between two ladies of rank, who
would have killed each other had they not been separated.
In a feminine duel on the Boulevard St. Antoine,
mentioned by De la Colombèire, both the principals
received several wounds on the face and bosom—a
most important fact illustrative of the pride
the fair sex take in those parts.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/40161/40161-h/40161-h.htm#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Sometimes ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
have distinguished themselves by fighting duels with
men. Mademoiselle Dureux fought her lover Antinotti
in an open street. The actress Maupin challenged
Dumény, but he declined to give her satisfaction;
so the lady stripped him of watch and snuff-box,
and bore them away as trophies of victory. The same
lady, on another occasion, having insulted in a ball-room
a distinguished personage of her own sex, was
requested by several gentlemen to quit the entertainment.
She obeyed, but forthwith challenged and
fought each of the meddlesome cavaliers—and killed
them all! The slaughter accomplished, she returned
to the ball-room, and danced in the presence of her
rival. The Marquise de Nesle and the Countess Polignac,
under the Regency, fought with pistols for the
possession of the Duc de Richelieu. In or about the
year 1827, a lady of Châteauroux, whose husband
had received a slap in the face, called out the offender,
and severely wounded him in a duel fought with
swords. The most dramatic affair of honour, however,
in the annals of female duelling occurred in
the year 1828, when a young French girl challenged
a <i>garde du corps</i> who had seduced her. At the meeting
the seconds took the precaution of loading without
ball, the fair principal of course being kept
in ignorance of the arrangement. She fired first and
saw her seducer remain unhurt. Without flinching,
or changing colour, she stood watching her adversary,
whilst he took a deliberate aim (in order to test her
courage), and then, after a painful pause, fired into
the air.</p>

<p>Physicians have been coupled with priests, as
beings holding a position between the two sexes. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
the Lancashire factories they allow women and clergymen
the benefit of an entrée—because they don't
understand business. Doctors and ladies could hardly
be coupled together by the same consideration;
but they might be put in one class out of respect
to that gentleness of demeanour and suavity of voice
which distinguish the members of the medical profession,
in common with well-bred women.</p>

<p>Gentle though they be, physicians have, however,
sometimes indulged in wordy wrangling, and then
had recourse to more sanguinary arguments.</p>

<p>The duel between Dr. Williams and Dr. Bennet was
one of the bloodiest in the eighteenth century. They
first battered each other with pamphlets, and then exchanged
blows. Matters having advanced so far, Dr.
Bennet proposed that the fight should be continued
in a gentlemanly style—with powder instead of fists.
The challenge was declined; whereupon Dr. Bennet
called on Dr. Williams, to taunt him with a charge
of cowardice. No sooner had he rapped at the door,
than it was opened by Williams himself, holding in
his hand a pistol loaded with swan-shot, which he,
without a moment's parley, discharged into his adversary's
breast. Severely wounded, Bennet retired
across the street to a friend's house, followed by Williams,
who fired another pistol at him. Such was the
demoniacal fury of Williams, that, not contented
with this outrage, he drew his sword, and ran Bennet
through the body. But this last blow was repaid.
Bennet managed to draw his rapier, and give his ferocious
adversary a home-thrust—his sword entering
the breast, coming out through the shoulder-blade,
and snapping short. Williams crawled back in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
direction of his house, but before he could reach it
fell down dead. Bennet lived only four hours. A
pleasant scene for the virtuous capital of a civilized
and Christian people!</p>

<p>The example of Dr. Bennet and Dr. Williams was
not lost upon the physicians of our American cousins.
In the August of 1830, a meeting took place, near
Philadelphia, between Dr. Smith and Dr. Jeffries.
They exchanged shots at eight paces, without inflicting
any injury, when their friends interposed, and
tried to arrange the difficulty; but Dr. Jeffries swore
that he would not leave the ground till some one had
been killed. The principals were therefore put up
again. At the second exchange of shots Dr. Smith's
right arm was broken, when he gallantly declared
that, as he was wounded, it would be gratifying to
his feelings, to be killed. Third exchange of shots,
and Dr. Smith, firing with his left arm, hits his man
in the thigh, causing immense loss of blood. Five
minutes were occupied in bandaging the wound;
when Dr. Jeffries, properly primed with brandy, requested
that no further obstacles might be raised
between him and satisfaction. For a fourth time the
mad men were put up—at the distance of six feet.
The result was fatal to both. Dr. Smith dropped dead
with a ball in his heart. Dr. Jeffries was shot through
the breast, and survived only a few hours. The conduct
of Dr. Jeffries during those last few hours was
admirable, and most delightfully in keeping with
the rest of the proceeding. On seeing his antagonist
prostrate, the doctor asked if he was dead. On being
assured that his enemy lived no longer, he observed,
"Then I die contented." He then stated that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
been a school-mate with Dr. Smith, and that, during
the fifteen years throughout which they had been on
terms of great intimacy and friendship, he had valued
him highly as a man of science and a gentleman.</p>

<p>One of the latest duels in which an English physician
was concerned as a principal was that fought on
the 10th of May, 1833, near Exeter, between Sir John
Jeffcott and Dr. Hennis. Dr. Hennis received a
wound, of which he died. The affair was brought
into the Criminal Court, and was for a short time
a <i>cause célèbre</i> on the western circuit; but the memory
of it has now almost entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>As we have already stated, duels have been rare in
the medical profession. Like the ladies, physicians
have, in their periods of anger, been content with
speaking ill of each other. That they have not lost
their power of courteous criticism and judicious
abuse, any one may learn, who, for a few hours,
breathes the atmosphere of their cliques. It is good
to hear an allopathic physician perform his duty to
society by frankly stating his opinion of the character
and conduct of an eminent homœopathic practitioner.
Perhaps it is better still to listen to an apostle of
homœopathy, when he takes up his parable and curses
the hosts of allopathy. "Sir, I tell you in confidence,"
observed a distinguished man of science, tapping
his auditor on the shoulder, and mysteriously
whispering in his ear, "I know <i>things</i> about <i>that man</i>
that would make him end his days in penal servitude."
The next day the auditor was closeted in the
consulting-room of <i>that man</i>, when that man said—quite
in confidence, pointing as he spoke to a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
box, and jingling a bunch of keys in his pocket—"I
have <i>papers</i> in that box, which, properly used, would
tie a certain friend of ours up by the neck."</p>

<p>Lettsom, loose-living man though he was for a member
of the Society of Friends, had enough of the
Quaker element in him to be very fond of controversy.
He dearly loved to expose quackery, and in
some cases did good service in that way. In the
<i>Medical Journal</i> he attacked, A. D. 1806, no less a man
than Brodum, the proprietor of the Nervous Cordial,
avowing that that precious compound had killed thousands;
and also stating that Brodum had added to
the crime of wholesale murder the atrocities of having
been born a Jew, of having been a shoe-black in
Copenhagen, and of having at some period of his
chequered career carried on an ignoble trade in oranges.
Of course Brodum saw his advantage. He
immediately brought an action against Phillips, the
proprietor of the <i>Medical Journal</i>, laying his damages
at £5000. The lawyers anticipated a harvest
from the case, and were proceeding not only against
Phillips, but various newsvendors also, when a newspaper
editor stept in between Phillips and Brodum,
and contrived to settle the dispute. Brodum's terms
were not modest ones. He consented to withdraw his
actions, if the name of the author was given up, and
if the author would whitewash him in the next number
of the Journal, under the same signature. Lettsom
consented, paid the two attorneys' bills, amounting
to £390, and wrote the required puff of Brodum
and his Nervous Cordial.</p>

<p>One of the singular characters of Dublin, a generation
ago, was John Brenan, M.D., a physician who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
edited the <i>Milesian Magazine</i>, a scurrilous publication
of the satirist class, that flung dirt on every one
dignified enough for the mob to take pleasure in seeing
him bespattered with filth. The man certainly
was a great blackguard, but was not destitute of
wit. How he carried on the war with the members
of his own profession the following song will show:—</p>

<p>Brenan (to do him justice) was as ready to fell a
professional antagonist and brother with a bludgeon,
hunting-whip, or pistol, as he was to scarify him
with doggerel. He was as bold a fellow as Dr. Walsh,
the Hibernian Æsculapius, who did his best to lay
Dr. Andrew Marshall down amongst the daisies and
the dead men. Andrew Marshall, when a divinity-student
at Edinburgh, was insulted (whilst officiating
for Stewart, the humanity professor) by a youngster
named Macqueen. The insolence of the lad was
punished by the professor (<i>pro tem.</i>) giving him a
caning. Smarting with the indignity offered him,
Macqueen ran home to his father, imploring vengeance;
whereupon the irate sire promptly sallied
forth, and entering Marshall's lodgings, exclaimed:—</p>

<p>"Are you the scoundrel that dared to attack my
son?"</p>

<p>"Draw and defend yourself!" screamed the divinity
student, springing from his chair, and presenting
a sword-point at the intruder's breast. Old
Macqueen, who had expected to have to deal only
with a timid half-starved usher ready to crouch
whiningly under personal castigation, was so astonished
at this reception that he turned and fled precipitately.
This little affair happened in 1775. As a
physician Andrew Marshall was not less valiant than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
he had been when a student of theology. On Walsh
challenging him, he went out and stood up at ten
paces like a gentleman. Walsh, a little short fellow,
invisible when looked at side-ways, put himself in
the regular attitude, shoulder to the front. Marshall
disdained such mean prudence, and faced his
would-be murdered with his cheeks and chest inflated
to the utmost. Shots were exchanged, Dr. Andrew
Marshall receiving a ball in his right arm, and Dr.
Walsh, losing a lock of hair—snipped off by his opponent's
bullet, and scattered by the amorous breeze.
Being thus the <i>gainer</i> in the affair, Dr. Andrew Marshall
made it up with his adversary, and they lived on
friendly terms ever afterwards. Why don't some
of our living <i>medici</i> bury the hatchet with a like effective
ceremony?</p>

<p>An affair that ended not less agreeably was that
in which Dr. Brocklesby was concerned as principal,
where the would-be belligerents left the ground without
exchanging shots, because their seconds could not
agree on the right number of paces at which to stick
up their man. When Akenside was fool enough to
challenge Ballow, a wicked story went about that
the fight didn't come off because one had determined
never to fight in the morning, and the other that he
would never fight in the afternoon. But the fact
was—Ballow was a paltry mean fellow, and shirked
the peril into which his ill-manners had brought him.
The lively and pleasant author of "Physic and Physicians,"
countenancing this unfair story, reminds us
of the off-hand style of John Wilkes in such little
affairs. When asked by Lord Talbot "How many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
times they were to fire?" the brilliant demagogue responded—</p>

<p>"Just as often as your Lordship pleases—I have
brought <i>a bag of bullets and a flask of gunpowder</i>
with me."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>THE LOVES OF PHYSICIANS.</h3>


<p>Honour has flowed to physicians by the regular
channels of professional duty in but scant allowance.
Their children have been frequently ennobled by marriage
or for political services. Sir Hans Sloane's
daughter Elizabeth, and manor of Chelsea, passed
into the Cadogan family, the lady marrying the second
Baron Cadogan. Like Sir Hans, Dr. Huck Sanders
left behind him two daughters, co-heiresses of
his wealth, of whom one (Jane) was ennobled through
wedlock, the tenth Earl of Westmoreland raising her
to be his second wife. Lord Combermere married
the heiress of Dr. Gibbings, of Cork. In the same
way Dr. Marwood's property came to the present Sir
Marwood Elton by the marriage of his grandfather
with Frances, the daughter and heiress of the Devonshire
doctor. On the other hand, as instances of
the offspring of physicians exalted to the ranks of
the aristocracy for their political services, the Lords
Sidmouth, Denman, and Kingsdown may be mentioned.
Henry Addington, created Viscount Sidmouth,
of the county of Devon, was the eldest son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
Anthony Addington, M.D., of Reading—the physician
who objected to fighting any brother physician
who had not graduated at either Oxford or Cambridge.
Dr. Anthony was the enthusiastic toady of
the great Earl of Chatham. Devoted to his own interests
and the Pitt family, he rose from the humble
position of keeper of a provincial lunatic asylum to
eminence in the medical profession. Coming up to
town in 1754, under the patronage of Pitt, he succeeded
in gaining the confidence of the Court, and
was, with Dr. Richard Warren, Dr. Francis Willis,
Dr. Thomas Gisborne, Sir Lucas Pepys, and Dr. Henry
Revell Reynolds, examined, in 1782, by the committee
appointed to examine "the physicians who attended
his illness, touching the state of his Majesty's
health." He took a very hopeful view of the king's
case; and on being asked the foundation of his hopes,
alluded to his experience in the treatment of the insane
at Reading. The doctor had himself a passion
for political intrigue, which descended to his son.
The career of this son, who raised himself to the
Speaker's chair in the House of Commons, to the dignity
of First Minister of the Crown, and to the peerage
of the realm, is matter of history.</p>

<p>Lord Denman was closely connected with the medical
profession by family ties: his father being Dr.
Denman, of Mount Street, Grosvenor Square, the author
of a well-known work on a department of his
profession; his uncle being Dr. Joseph Denman of
Bakewell; and his two sisters having married two
eminent physicians, Margaret being the wife of Sir
Richard Croft, Bart., and Sophia the wife of Dr. Baillie.
Lord Kingsdown's medical ancestor was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
grandfather, Edward Pemberton, M.D., of Warrington.</p>

<p>But though the list of the ennobled descendants
of medical practitioners might be extended to the limits
of a volume, the writer of these pages is not aware
of any case in which a doctor has, by the exercise
of his calling, raised himself to the peerage. As yet,
the dignity of a baronetcy is the highest honour conferred
on the most illustrious of the medical faculty,
Sir Hans Sloane being the first of the order to whom
that rank was presented. More than once a physician
has won admission into the <i>noblesse</i>, but the battle
resulting in such success has been fought in the
arena of politics or the bustle of the law courts. Sylvester
Douglas deserted the counter, at which he commenced
life an apothecary, and after a prolonged
servitude to, or warfare with, the cliques of the House
of Commons, had his exertions rewarded and his ambition
gratified with an Irish peerage and a patrician
wife. On his elevation he was of course taunted with
the humility of his origin, and by none was the reproach
flung at him with greater bitterness than it
was by a brother <i>parvenu</i> and brother poet.</p>

<p>"What's his title to be?" asked Sheridan, as he
was playing at cards; "what's Sylvester Douglas to
be called?"</p>

<p>"Lord Glenbervie," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" replied Sheridan; and then he proceeded
to fire off an <i>impromptu</i>, which he had that
morning industriously prepared in bed, and which
he subsequently introduced into one of his best satiric
pieces.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Glenbervie, Glenbervie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i1">What's good for the scurvy?<br></span>
<span class="i0">For ne'er be your old trade forgot.<br></span>
<span class="i1">In your arms rather quarter<br></span>
<span class="i1">A pestle and mortar,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And your crest be a spruce gallipot."</span>
</div>

<p>The brilliant partizan and orator displayed more
wit, if not better taste, in his ridicule of Addington,
who, in allusion to the rise of his father from a humble
position in the medical profession, was ordinarily
spoken of by political opponents as "The Doctor."
On one occasion, when the Scotch members who usually
supported Addington voted in a body with the
opposition, Sheridan, with a laugh of triumph, fired
off a happy mis-quotation from Macbeth,—"Doctor,
the Thanes fly from thee."</p>

<p>Henry Bickersteth, Lord Langdale, was the luckiest
of physicians and lawyers. He used the medical
profession as a stepping-stone, and the legal profession
as a ladder, and had the fortune to win two of
the brightest prizes of life—wealth and a peerage—without
the humiliation and toil of serving a political
party in the House of Commons. The second son of
a provincial surgeon, he was apprenticed to his father,
and educated for the paternal calling. On being
qualified to kill, he became medical attendant to the
late Earl of Oxford, during that nobleman's travels
on the Continent. Returning to his native town, Kirby
Lonsdale, he for awhile assisted his father in the
management of his practice; but resolved on a different
career from that of a country doctor, he became
a member of Caius College, Cambridge, and devoted
himself to mathematical study with such success that,
in 1808, when he was twenty-eight years old, he became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
Senior Wrangler and First Smith's prizeman.
As late as the previous year he was consulted medically
by his father. In 1811 he was called to the bar
by the Inner Temple, and from that time till his elevation
to the Mastership of the Rolls he was both the
most hard-working and hard-worked of the lawyers
in the Equity Courts, to which he confined his practice.
In 1827 he became a bencher of his Inn; and,
in 1835, although he was a staunch and zealous liberal,
and a strenuous advocate of Jeremy Bentham's
opinions, he was offered a seat on the judicial bench
by Sir Robert Peel. This offer he declined, though
he fully appreciated the compliment paid him by
the Tory chieftain. He had not, however, to wait
long for his promotion. In the following year (1836)
he was, by his own friends, made Master of the Rolls,
and created a peer of the realm, with the additional
honour of being a Privy-Councillor. His Lordship
died at Tunbridge Wells, in 1851, in his sixty-eighth
year. It would be difficult to point to a more enviable
career in legal annals than that of this medical lawyer,
who won the most desirable honours of his profession
without ever sitting in the House of Commons,
or acting as a legal adviser of the Crown—and when
he had not been called quite twenty-five years. To
give another touch to this picture of a successful
life, it may be added, that Lord Langdale, after rising
to eminence, married Elizabeth, daughter of the Earl
of Oxford, to whom he had formerly been travelling
medical attendant.</p>

<p>Love has not unfrequently smiled on doctors, and
elevated them to positions at which they would never
have arrived by their professional labours. Sir Lucas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
Pepys, who married the Countess De Rothes, and Sir
Henry Halford, whose wife was a daughter of the
eleventh Lord St. John of Blestoe, are conspicuous
amongst the more modern instances of medical practitioners
advancing their social condition by aristocratic
alliances. Not less fortunate was the farcical
Sir John Hill, who gained for a bride the Honourable
Miss Jones, a daughter of Lord Ranelagh—a nobleman
whose eccentric opinion, that the welfare of
the country required a continual intermixture of the
upper and lower classes of society, was a frequent object
of ridicule with the caricaturists and lampoon-writers
of his time. But the greatest prize ever made
by an Æsculapius in the marriage-market was that
acquired by Sir Hugh Smithson, who won the hand of
Percy's proud heiress, and was created Duke of
Northumberland. The son of a Yorkshire baronet's
younger son, Hugh Smithson was educated for an
apothecary—a vocation about the same time followed
for several years by Sir Thomas Geery Cullum, before
he succeeded to the family estate and dignity.
Hugh Smithson's place of business was Hatton Garden,
but the length of time that he there presided over
a pestle and mortar is uncertain. In 1736 he became
a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, but he withdrew
from that learned body, on the books of which
his signature may be found, in the year 1740. A few
months after this secession, Sir Hugh led to the altar
the only child and heiress of Algernon Seymour,
Duke of Somerset. There still lives a tradition that
the lady made the offer to Sir Hugh immediately after
his rejection by a famous belle of private rank and
modest wealth. Another version of the story is that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
when she heard of his disappointment, she observed
publicly, "that the disdainful beauty was a fool, and
that no other woman in England would be guilty of
like folly." On hearing this, the baronet, a singularly
handsome man, took courage to sue for that to
which men of far higher rank would not have presumed
to aspire. The success that followed his daring,
of course, brought upon him the arrows of envy.
He had won so much, however, that he could, without
ill-humour, bear being laughed at. On being
created Duke of Northumberland in 1766, he could
afford to smile at a proposition that his coronet
should be surrounded with senna, instead of strawberry-leaves;
for, however much obscure jealousy
might affect to contemn him, he was no fit object for
disdain—but a gentleman of good intellect and a
lordly presence, and (though he had mixed drugs
behind a counter) descended from an old and honourable
family. The reproach of being a Smithson,
and no Percy, had more force when applied to the
second duke in the Anti-Jacobin, than it had when
hurled vindictively at the ex-doctor himself by the
mediocrities of the <i>beau monde</i>, whom he had beaten
on their own ground by superior attractions and accomplishments.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nay," quoth the Duke, "in thy black scroll<br></span>

</div></div>

<p>Considering the opportunities that medical men
have for pressing a suit in love, and the many temptations
to gentle emotion that they experience in the
aspect of feminine suffering, and the confiding gratitude
of their fair patients, it is perhaps to be wondered
at that only one medical duke is to be found
in the annals of the peerage. When Swift's Stella
was on her death-bed, her physician said, encouragingly—"Madam,
you are certainly near the bottom of
the hill, but we shall endeavour to get you up once
more," the <i>naïve</i> reply of the poor lady was, "Doctor,
I am afraid I shall be out <i>of breath</i> before I get
to the top again." Not less touching was the fear
expressed by Steele's merry daughter to her doctor,
that she should "die <i>before the holidays</i>." Both Stella
and Sir Richard's child had left their personal
charms behind them when they so addressed their
physicians; but imagine, my brother, what the effect
of such words would be on your susceptible heart,
if they came from the lips of a beautiful girl.
Would you not (think you) try to win other such
speeches from her?—and if you tried, dear sir, surely
<i>you</i> would succeed!</p>

<p>Prudence would order a physician, endowed with
a heart, to treat it in the same way as Dr. Glynn
thought a cucumber ought to be dressed—to slice it
very thin, pepper it plentifully, pour upon it plenty
of the best vinegar, and then—throw it away. A doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
has quite enough work on his hands to keep the
affections of his patients in check, without having to
mount guard over his own emotions. Thackeray says
that girls make love in the nursery, and practise the
arts of coquetry on the page-boy who brings the coals
upstairs—a hard saying for simple young gentlemen
triumphing in the possession of a <i>first</i> love. The
writer of these pages could point to a fair dame, who
enjoys rank amongst the highest and wealth equal to
the station assigned her by the heralds, who not only
aimed tender glances, and sighed amorously to a
young waxen-faced, blue-eyed apothecary, but even
went so far as to write him a letter proposing an
elopement, and other merry arrangements, in which
a carriage, everlastingly careering over the country
at the heels of four horses, bore a conspicuous part.
The silly maiden had, like Dinah, "a fortune in
silvyer and gold," amounting to £50,000, and her
blue-eyed Adonis was twice her age; but fortunately
he was a gentleman of honour, and, without divulging
the mad proposition of the young lady, he induced
her father to take her away for twelve months'
change of air and scene. Many years since the
heroine of this little episode, after she had become
the wife of a very great man, and the mother of
children who bid fair to become ornaments to their
illustrious race, expressed her gratitude cordially to
this Joseph of the doctors, for his magnanimity in
not profiting by the absurd fancies of a child, and the
delicacy with which he had taken prompt measures
for her happiness; and, more recently, she manifested
her good will to the man who had offered her what is
generally regarded as the greatest insult a woman can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
experience, by procuring a commission in the army
for his eldest son.</p>

<p>The embarrassments Sir John Eliot suffered under
from the emotional overtures of his fair patients are
well known. St. John Long himself had not more admirers
amongst the <i>élite</i> of high-born English ladies.
The king had a strong personal dislike to Sir John,—a
dislike possibly heightened by a feeling that it
was sheer impudence in a doctor to capture without
an effort the hearts of half the prettiest women
amongst his subjects—and then shrug his shoulders
with chagrin at his success. Lord George Germain
had hard work to wring a baronetcy out of his Majesty
for this victim of misplaced affection.</p>

<p>"Well," said the king, at last grudgingly promising
to make Eliot a baronet—"my Lord, since you
desire it, let it be; but remember he shall not be my
physician."</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered Lord George—"he shall be
your Majesty's baronet, and my physician."</p>

<p>Amongst other plans Sir John resorted to, to scare
away his patients and patronesses, he had a death's-head
painted on his carriage-panels; but the result
of this eccentric measure on his practice and on his
sufferings was the reverse of what he desired. One
lady—the daughter of a noble member of a Cabinet—ignorant
that he was otherwise occupied, made
him an offer, and on learning to her astonishment
that he was a married man, vowed that she would not
rest till she had assassinated his wife.</p>

<p>Poor Radcliffe's loves were of a less flattering sort,
though they resembled Sir John Eliot's in respect of
being instances of reciprocity all on one side. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
amorous follies of Radcliffe, ludicrous though they
became under the touches of Steele's pen, are dignified
and manly when compared with the senile
freaks of Dr. Mead, whose highest delight was to comb
the hair of the lady on whom, for the time being, his
affections were set.</p>

<p>Dr. Cadogan, of Charles the Second's time, was,
like Sir John Eliot, a favourite with the ladies. His
wont was to spend his days in shooting and his evenings
in flirtation. To the former of these tastes the
following lines refer:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Doctor, all game you either ought to shun,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or sport no longer with the unsteady gun;<br></span>
<span class="i0">But like physicians of undoubted skill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Gladly attempt what never fails to kill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Not lead's uncertain dross, but physic's deadly pill."</span>
</div>

<p>Whether he was a good shot we cannot say; but he
was sufficiently adroit as a squire of dames, for he
secured as his wife a wealthy lady, over whose property
he had unfettered control. Against the money,
however, there were two important points figuring
under the head of "set-off"—the bride was old and
querulous. Of course such a woman was unfitted to
live happily with an eminent physician, on whom
bevies of court ladies smiled whenever he went west
of Charing Cross. After spending a few months in
alternate fits of jealous hate and jealous fondness,
the poor creature conceived the terrible fancy that
her husband was bent on destroying her with poison,
and so ridding his life of her execrable temper. One
day, when surrounded by her friends, and in the
presence of her lord and master, she fell on her
back in a state of hysterical spasms, exclaiming:—</p>

<p>"Ah! he has killed me at last. I am poisoned!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>"Poisoned!" cried the lady-friends, turning up the
whites of their eyes. "Oh! gracious goodness!—you
have done it, doctor!"</p>

<p>"What do you accuse me of?" asked the doctor,
with surprise.</p>

<p>"I accuse you—of—killing me—ee," responded
the wife, doing her best to imitate a death-struggle.</p>

<p>"Ladies," answered the doctor, with admirable
<i>nonchalance</i>, bowing to Mrs. Cadogan's bosom associates,
"it is perfectly false. You are quite welcome
to open her at once, and then you'll discover the
calumny."</p>

<p>John Hunter administered a scarcely less startling
reproof to his wife, who, though devoted in her attachment
to him, and in every respect a lady worthy
of esteem, caused her husband at times no little vexation
by her fondness for society. She was in the habit
of giving enormous routs, at which authors and artists,
of all shades of merit and demerit, used to assemble
to render homage to her literary powers,
which were very far from common-place. A lasting
popularity has attested the excellence of her song:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My mother bids me bind my hair<br></span>
<span class="i1">With bands of rosy hue;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Tie up my sleeves with ribbons rare,<br></span>
<span class="i1">And lace my boddice blue.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'For why,' she cries, 'sit still and weep,<br></span>
<span class="i1">While others dance and play?'<br></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! I scarce can go or creep,<br></span>
<span class="i1">While Lubin is away.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis sad to think the days are gone,<br></span>
<span class="i1">When those we love are near;<br></span>
<span class="i0">I sit upon this mossy stone,<br></span>
<span class="i1">And sigh when none can hear.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And while I spin my flaxen thread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i1">And sing my simple lay,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The village seems asleep or dead,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Now Lubin is away."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>John Hunter had no sympathy with his wife's poetical
aspirations, still less with the society which those
aspirations led her to cultivate. Grudging the time
which the labours of practice prevented him from
devoting to the pursuits of his museum and laboratory
he could not restrain his too irritable temper
when Mrs. Hunter's frivolous amusements deprived
him of the quiet requisite for study. Even the fee
of a patient who called him from his dissecting instruments
could not reconcile him to the interruption.
"I must go," he would say reluctantly to his friend
Lynn, when the living summoned him from his investigations
among the dead, "and earn this d——d
guinea, or I shall be sure to want it to-morrow."
Imagine the wrath of such a man, finding, on his return
from a long day's work, his house full of musical
professors, connoisseurs, and fashionable idlers—in
fact, all the confusion and hubbub and heat of a
grand party, which his lady had forgotten to inform
him was that evening to come off! Walking straight
into the middle of the principal reception-room, he
faced round and surveyed his unwelcome guests, who
were not a little surprised to see him—dusty, toilworn,
and grim—so unlike what "the man of the
house" ought to be on such an occasion.</p>

<p>"I knew nothing," was his brief address to the astounded
crowd—"I knew nothing of this kick-up,
and I ought to have been informed of it beforehand;
but, as I have now returned home to study, I hope the
present company will retire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>Mrs Hunter's drawing-rooms were speedily empty.</p>

<p>One of the drollest love stories in medical ana is
that which relates to Dr. Thomas Dawson, a century
since alike admired by the inhabitants of Hackney
as a pulpit orator and a physician. Dawson was
originally a Suffolk worthy, unconnected, however,
with the eccentric John Dawson, who, in the reign
of Charles the Second, was an apothecary in the pleasant
old town of Framlingham, in that county. His
father, a dissenting minister, had seven sons, and
educated six of them for the Nonconformist pulpit.
Of these six, certainly three joined the Established
Church, and became rectors—two of the said three,
Benjamin and Abraham, being controversial writers
of considerable merit. Thomas Dawson adhered to
the tenets of his father, and, combining the vocations
of divine and physic-man, preached on Sundays, and
doctored during the rest of the week. He was Mead
and Mead's father in one: though the conditions of
human existence, which render it impossible for one
person to be in two places at the same time, prevented
him from leaving chapel to visit his patients,
and the next minute urging the congregation to offer
up a prayer for the welfare of the unfortunate sufferers.
Amongst the doctor's circle of acquaintance
Miss Corbett of Hackney was at the same time the
richest, the most devout, and the most afflicted in
bodily health. Ministering to her body and soul, Dr.
Dawson had frequent occasions for visiting her. One
day he found her alone, sitting with the large family
Bible before her, meditating on perhaps the grandest
chapter in all the Old Testament. The doctor
read the words to which the forefinger of her right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
hand pointed—the words of Nathan to David:
"<i>Thou art the man</i>." The doctor took the hint; and
on the 29th of May, 1758, he found a wife—and the
pious lady won a husband. The only offspring of
this strange match was one son, a Mr. Dawson, who
still resides at a very advanced age of life in the
charming village of Botesdale, in Suffolk. When
the writer of these pages was a happy little boy, making
his first acquaintance with Latin and Greek, at
the Botesdale Grammar School, then presided over
by the pious, manly, and gentle ——, he was an especial
pet with Mr. Dawson. The worthy gentleman's
little house was in the centre of a large garden,
densely stocked with apple and other fruit trees; and
in it he led a very retired life, visited by only a very
few friends, and tended by two or three servants—of
whom one, an ancient serving man, acted as a
valet, gardener, and groom to an antique horse which
constituted Mr. Dawson's entire stud. The small
urchin before-mentioned had free access at all times
to the venerable gentleman, and used to bring him the
gossip of the town and school, in exchange for apples
and other substantial gifts. Thin and attenuated,
diminutive, so as to be little more than a
dwarf, with vagrant eager eye, hooked as to his nose,
and with a long beard, snowy-white, streaming over
his waistcoat, the octogenarian used to receive his
fair-haired child-visitor. May he be happy—as may
all old gentlemen be, who are kind to little schoolboys,
and give them apples and "tips!"</p>

<p>The day that Abernethy was married he went down
to the lecture-room to deliver his customary instruction
to his pupils. His selection of a wife was as judicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
as his marriage was happy; and the funny
stories for long current about the mode in which he
made his offer are known to be those most delusive
of fabrications, fearless and extreme exaggerations
of a little particle of the truth. The brutality of
procedure attributed to the great surgeon by current
rumour was altogether foreign to his nature. The
Abernethy biscuit was not more audaciously pinned
upon his reputation, than was the absurd falsehood
that when he made his offer to his future wife he had
only seen her once, and then wrote saying he should
like to marry her, but as he was too busy to "make
love," she must entertain his proposal without further
preliminaries, and let him know her decision by the
end of the week.</p>

<p>Of Sir John Eliot the fortunate, mention has already
been made in this chapter. Let us now speak
of John Eliot, the luckless hero of a biography published
in 1787, under the title of "A Narrative of
the Life and Death of John Eliot, M.D., containing
an account of the Rise, Progress, and Catastrophe of
his unhappy passion for Miss Mary Boydell." A
native of Somersetshire, John Elliot wrote a tragedy
when only twelve years of age, and after serving an
apprenticeship to a London apothecary, fell in love
with one Miss Mary Boydell, a niece of a city alderman.
The course of this gentleman's love ran smoothly
till he chanced, by evil fortune, to read an announcement
in a newspaper, that a Miss Boydell had,
on the previous day, been led to the altar by some
gentleman—not called Dr. John Elliot, certainly not
himself. Never doubting that <i>the</i> Miss Boydell of
the newspaper was <i>his</i> Miss Boydell, the doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
without making any further inquiries after the perfidious
fair one, sold his shop and fixtures, and ran
off from the evil city of heartless women, to commune
with beasts of the field and birds of the air in
sylvan retirement. Not a little chagrined was Miss
Boydell at the sudden disappearance of her ideal
apothecary, whom her uncle, the alderman, stigmatized
in round, honest, indignant language, as a big
blackguard. After twelve years spent in wandering,
"a forlorn wretch, over the kingdom," Dr. Elliott
returned to London, set up once more in business,
and began, for a second time, to drive a thriving
trade, when Delilah again crossed his path. "One
day," he says, telling his own story, "entering my
shop (for I had commenced again the business of
apothecary) I found two ladies sitting there, one of
whom I thought I could recognize. As soon as she
observed me, she cried out, 'Mr. Elliot! Mr. Elliot!'
and fell back in a swoon. The well-known voice
struck me like a shock of electricity—my affections
instantly gushed forth—I fell senseless at her feet.
When I came to myself, I found Miss Boydell sitting
by my side." And <i>his</i> Miss Boydell was Miss Boydell
still—innocent of wedlock.</p>

<p>Imogene being proved true, and Alonzo having
come to life, the youthful couple renewed the engagement
entered into more than twelve years before.
The wedding-day was fixed, the wedding-clothes
were provided, when uncle (the alderman),
distrustful that his niece's scranny lover would make
a good husband, induced her at the last moment to
jilt him, and marry Mr. Nicols, an opulent bookseller.
The farce was now to wear an aspect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
tragedy. Infuriated at being, after all, <i>really</i> deceived,
Dr. Elliot bought two brace of pistols, and
bound them together in pairs. One pair he loaded
only with powder; into the other he put the proper
quantum of lead, as well as the pernicious dust.
Armed with these weapons, he lay in wait for the
destroyer of his peace. After some days of watching
he saw her in Prince's Street, walking with the triumphant
Nicols. Rushing up, he fired at her the
two pistols (not loaded with ball), and then snatching
the other brace from his pocket, was proceeding
to commit suicide, when he was seized by the bystanders
and disarmed.</p>

<p>The next scene in the drama was the principal court
of the Old Bailey, with Dr. Elliot in the dock, charged
with an attempt to murder Miss Boydell. The jury,
being satisfied that the pistols were not loaded with
ball, and that the prisoner only intended to create
a startling impression on Miss Boydell's mind, acquitted
him of that charge, and he was remanded
to prison to take his trial for a common assault. Before
this second inquiry, however, could come off, the
poor man died in Newgate, July 22, 1787, of a broken
heart—or jail fever. Ere his death, he took a cruel
revenge of the lady, by writing an autobiographic
account of his love experiences, in which appeared
the following passage:—"Fascinated as I was by the
charms of this faithless woman, I had long ceased to
be sensible to these defects, or rather my impassioned
imagination had converted them into perfections.
But those who did not labour under the power of
this magic were struck by her ungraceful exterior,
and mine ears have not unfrequently been shocked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
hear the tongue of indifference pronounce that the
object of my passion was <i>ugly and deformed</i>. Add
to this, that Miss Boydell has long since ceased to
boast the bloom of youth, and then let any person,
impartial and unprejudiced, decide whether a passion
for her, so violent as that I have manifested, could
be the produce of a slight and recent acquaintance,
or whether it must not rather be the consequence of
a long habit and inveterate intimacy." Such was
the absurd sad story of John Elliot, author of "The
Medical Almanack," "Elements of the Branches of
Natural Philosophy," and "Experiments and Observations
on Light and Colours."</p>

<p>The mournful love-story of Dr. John Elliot made a
deep impression on the popular mind. It is found alluded
to in ballads and chap-books, and more than
one penny romance was framed upon it. Not improbably
it suggested the composition of the following
parody of Monk Lewis's "Alonzo the Brave and the
Fair Imogene," which appeared at the close of the
last century, during the first run of popularity which
that familiar ballad obtained:—</p>

<p>In the court of love, Dr. Van Buchell, the empiric,
may pass muster as a physician. When that droll
charlatan lost his first wife, in 1775, he paid her the
compliment of preserving her body with great care.
Dr. Hunter, with the assistance of Mr. Cruikshank, injected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
the blood-vessels of the corpse with a carmine
fluid, so that the cheeks and lips had the hue
of healthy life; the cavities of the body were artistically
packed with the antiseptics used by modern embalmers;
and glass eyes were substituted in place of
the filmy balls which Death had made his own.
Decked in a dainty apparel of lace and finest linen,
the body was then placed in a bed of thin paste of
plaster of Paris, which, crystallizing, made a most ornamental
couch. The case containing this fantastic
horror had a glass lid, covered with a curtain; and
as Van Buchell kept it in his ordinary sitting-room,
he had the pleasure of introducing his visitors to the
lifeless form of his "dear departed." For several
years the doctor lived very happily with this slough
of an immortal soul—never quarrelling with it, never
being scolded by it—on the whole, enjoying an
amount of domestic tranquility that rarely falls to
one man's lot. Unwisely he made in advanced years
a new alliance, and manifested a desire to be on with
the new and the old love at the same time. To this
Mrs. Van Buchell (No. 2) strongly objected, and insisted
that the quaint coffin of Mrs. Van Buchell (No.
1) should be removed from the parlour in which she
was expected to spend the greatest part of her days.
The eccentric mode in which Buchell displayed his
affection for his first wife was scarcely less repulsive
than the devotion to the interests of anatomical science
which induced Rondeletius to dissect the dead
body of his own child in his theatre at Montpelier.</p>

<p>Are there no more loves to be mentioned? Yes; let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
these concluding pages tell an interesting story of the
last generation.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago the picturesque, sunny town of
Holmnook had for its physician one Dr. Kemp, a
grave and reverend Æsculapius, punctilious in etiquette,
with an imposing formality of manner, accurate
in costume, in every respect a courtier of the
old school. Holmnook is an antique market-town,
square and compact, a capital in miniature, lying at
the foot of an old feudal castle, in which the Bigods
once held sway. That stronghold of moated towers
was three centuries since the abode of a mighty Duke;
Surrey, the poet earl, luckless and inspired, was born
within its walls. The noble acres of the princely
house fell into the hands of a <i>parvenu</i>—a rich, grasping
lawyer;—that was bad. The lawyer died and
went to his place, leaving the land to the poor;—that
was better. And now the produce of the rich soil,
which whilom sent forth a crop of mailed knights,
supports a college of toil and time-worn peasants,
saving their cold thin blood from the penury of the
poor-house, and sheltering them from the contumelies
of—Guardians of the Poor. Hard by the college,
housing these ancient humble children of man, is a
school, based on the same beneficent foundation,
where the village lads are taught by as ripe a scholar
and true a gentleman as ever came from the banks of
Isis; and round which temple of learning they play
their rough, noisy games, under the observation of
the veterans of the bourg—the almsmen and almswomen
who sit in the sun and on benches before their
college, clad in the blue coats of the charity, and
feeling no shame in them, though the armorial badge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
of that old lawyer is tacked upon them in red cloth.</p>

<p>Holmnook is unlike most other English towns of its
size, abounding as it does in large antique mansions,
formerly inhabited by the great officers and dependents
on the ducal household, who in many cases were
blood relations of the duke himself. Under the capacious
windows of these old houses, in the streets,
and round the market-square, run rows of limes,
spreading their cool shade over the pinnacles of gabled
roofs, and flinging back bars across the shining
shingle which decorates the plaster walls of the older
houses. In the centre of the town stands an enormous
church, large enough to hold an entire army
of Christians, and containing many imposing tombs
of earls and leaders, long since gone to their account.</p>

<p>Think of this old town, its venerable dwellings—each
by itself suggesting a romance. Hear the cooing
and lazy flapping of pigeons, making continual holiday
round the massive chimneys. Observe, without
seeming to observe, the mayor's pretty daughter sitting
at the open oriel window of the Guild-hall, merrily
singing over her needle-work, and wondering if
her bright ribbon has a good effect on passers below.
Heed the jingle of a harpsichord in the rector's parlour.
Be pleased to remember that the year is 1790—not
1860. Take a glass of stinging ale at "The
Knight of Armour" hostelry—and own you enjoy it.
Take another, creaming good-naturedly up under
your lip, and confess you like it better than its predecessor.
See the High Sheriff's carriage pass through
the excited town, drawn by four enormous black
horses, and having three Bacchic footmen hanging on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
behind. Do all this, and then you'll have a faint notion
of Holmnook, its un-English picturesqueness, its
placid joy, and experience of pomp.</p>

<p>Who is the gentleman emerging from the mansion
on the causeway, in this year 1790—with white peruke
and long pig-tail, snuff-coloured coat and velvet
collar, tight dark nether garments, silk stockings, and
shoes with buckles, volumes of white shirt-frill rising
up under his chin? As he taps his shoes on his doorstep
you can see he is proud of his leg, a pleasant
pride, whether one has reason for it or not!</p>

<p>Seventy years of age, staid, decorous, and thoroughly
versed in the social proprieties of the old
world, now gone clean from us, like chivalry or chartism,
Dr. Kemp was an important personage in Holmnook
and its vicinity. An <i>éclat</i> was his that a country
doctor does not usually possess. For he was of
gentle blood, being a cadet of an old and wealthy family
on the other side of the country, the representative
of which hailed him "cousin," and treated
him with the intimacy of kinship—the kinship of
1790.</p>

<p>Michael Kemp's youth had been spent away from
Holmnook. Doubtless so polite and dignified a gentleman
had once aimed at a brighter lot than a rural
physician's. Doubtless he had a history, but he kept
it to himself. He had never married! The rumour
went that he had been disappointed—had undertaken
the conquest of a high-born lady, who gave another
ending to the game; and having conquered
him, went off to conquer others. Ladies could do
such things in the last century—when men had hearts.</p>

<p>Anyhow, Michael Kemp, M.D., was an old bachelor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
of spotless honour, and a reputation that scandal
never dared to trifle with.</p>

<p>A lady, much respected by the simple inhabitants
of Holmsnook, kept his house.</p>

<p>Let us speak of her—fair and forty, comely, with
matronly outlines, but graceful. Pleasant of voice,
cheerful in manner, active in benevolence, Mistress
Alice was a great favourite; no christening or wedding
could go off without her for miles around. The
doctor's grandest patients treated her as an equal;
for apart from her personal claims to respect and
good-will, she was, it was understood, of the doctor's
blood—a poor relation, gentle by birth as she was by
education. Mistress Alice was a great authority
amongst the Holmnook ladies, on all matters pertaining
to dress and taste. Her own ordinary costume
was an artistic one. A large white kerchief, made so
as to sit like a jacket, close and high round the
throat, concealed her fair arms and shoulders, and
reached down to the waist of her dress, which, in
obedience to the fashion of the time, ran close beneath
her arms. In 1790 a lady's waist at Holmnook
occupied just about the same place where the drapery
of a London belle's Mazeppa harness offers its first
concealment to its wearer's charms. But it was on
her foot-gear that Mistress Alice devoted especial
care. The short skirts of that day encouraged a
woman to set her feet off to the best advantage. Mistress
Alice wore natty high-heeled shoes and clocked
stockings—bright crimson stockings with yellow
clocks.</p>

<p>Do you know what clocked stockings were, ladies?
This writer is not deeply learned on such matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
but having seen a pair of Mistress Alice's stockings,
he can tell you that they had on either side, extending
from the heel upwards some six inches, flowers
gracefully embroidered with a light yellow silk on the
crimson ground. And these wreaths of broidery were
by our ancestors called clocks. This writer could tell
something else about Mistress Alice's apparel. She
had for grand evenings of high festivity white kid
gloves reaching up to the elbow, and having a slit at
the tips of the forefinger and thumb of each hand.
It was an ordinary fashion long syne. So, ladies
could let out the tips of those digits to take a pinch
of snuff!</p>

<p>One night Michael Kemp, M.D., Oxon., was called
up to come with every possible haste to visit a sick
lady, urgently in want of him. The night-bell was
rung violently, and the messenger cried to the doctor
over and over from the pavement below to make good
speed. The doctor did his best to comply; but, as
ill-luck would have it, after he had struck a light the
candle illumined by it fell down, and left the doctor
in darkness. This was very annoying to the good
man, for he could not reconcile it to his conscience
to consume time in lighting another, and yet it was
hard for such a decorous man to make his hasty toilet
in the dark.</p>

<p>He managed, however, better than he expected.
His peruke came to hand all right; so did the tight
inexpressibles; so did the snuff-coloured coat with
high velvet collar; so did the buckled shoes. Bravo!</p>

<p>In another five minutes the active physician had
groped his way down-stairs, emerged from his stately
dwelling, and had run to his patient's house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>In a trice he was admitted; in a twinkle he was
up the stairs; in another second he was by the sick
lady's bedside, round which were seated a nurse and
three eminent Holmnook gossips.</p>

<p>He was, however, little prepared for the reception
he met with—the effect his appearance produced.</p>

<p>The sick lady, struggling though she was with severe
pain, laughed outright.</p>

<p>The nurse said, "Oh my!—Doctor Kemp!"</p>

<p>Gossip No. 1 exclaimed, "Oh, you'll kill me!"</p>

<p>Gossip No. 2 cried, "I can't believe my eyes!"</p>

<p>Gossip No. 3 exploded with—"Oh, Doctor Kemp,
do look at your stockings!"</p>

<p>And the doctor, obeying, did look at his stockings.
One was of black silk—the other was a crimson one,
with yellow clocks.</p>

<p>Was there not merry talk the next day at Holmnook!
Didn't one hear blithe hearty laughter at every
street corner—at every window under the limes?</p>

<p>What did they laugh about? What did they say?</p>

<p>Only this, fair reader—</p>

<p class="center">
"<i>Honi soit qui mal y pense</i>."<br>
</p>

<p>God bless thee, Holmnook! The bells of thy old
church-tower are jangling in my ears though thou art
a hundred miles away. I see the blue heavens kissing
thy limes!</p>

<p>The old proverb says, "Every man is a physician or
a fool by forty." Sir Henry Halford happening to
quote the old saw to a circle of friends, Canning,
with a pleasant humour smiling in his eyes, inquired,
"Sir Henry, mayn't he be both?"</p>

<p>John Locke, according to academic registration,
was not a physician till he was past forty. Born in
1632, he took his M.B. degree Feb. 6th, 1674. To
what extent he exercised his profession is still a matter
of dispute; but there is no doubt that he was for
some period an active practitioner of it. Of his letters
to Hans Sloane, that are still extant, the following
is one:—</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—<br>
</p>

<p>"I have a patient here sick of the fever at
this season. It seems not violent; but I am told 'tis
a sort that is not easily thrown off. I desire to know
of you what your fevers in town are, and what methods
you find most successful in them? I shall be
obliged by your favour if you will give me a word or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
two by to-morrow's post, and direct it to me, to be
left at Mr Harrison's, in the 'Crown,' at Harlow.</p>

<p class="signature">
"I am, Sir,<br>
"Your most humble servant,<br>
"<span class="smcap">J Locke</span>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Popularly the name of Locke is as little associated
with the profession of medicine as that of Sir James
Mackintosh, who was a practising physician, till ambition
and poverty made him select a more lucrative
vocation, and turn his energies to the bar.</p>

<p>Distinguished amongst literary physicians was Andrew
Borde, who studied Medicine at Oxford and
Montpelier, and it is said acted as a physician in the
service of Henry the Eighth. Borde's career has hitherto
been a puzzle to antiquaries who, though interested
in it, have been able to discover only little about
it. It was his whim to sign himself Andrew Perforatus
(his name really signifying "a cottage,"—"bordarius=a
cottager"). In the same way after him
Robert Fludd, the Rosicrucian doctor, adopted for
his signature Robertus de Fluctibus. In his works
he occasionally gives the reader a glimpse of his
personal adventures; and from contemporary literature,
as well as tradition, we learn enough to feel justified
in believing that he created the cant term "Merry
Andrew."</p>

<p>Of his freaks, about the most absurd was his conduct
when acting as foreman of a jury in a small
borough town. A prisoner was charged with stealing
a pair of leather breeches, but though appearances
were strongly against the accused (who was a
notorious rogue), the evidence was so defective that
to return a verdict of guilty on the charge was beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
the logic and conscience of the twelve good men
and true. No course seemed open to them but to acquit
the knave; when Andrew Borde prevailed on
them, <i>as</i> the evidence of stealing the leather breeches
was so defective, to bring him in guilty of manslaughter.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the jurymen took Andrew's
advice, and finding a verdict to the best of
those abilities with which it had pleased God to bless
them, astonished the judge and the public, not less
than the prisoner, with the strange conclusion at
which they had arrived.</p>

<p>Anthony à Wood and Hearne tell us the little that
has hitherto been known of this eccentric physician.
To that little an important addition may be made
from the following letter, never before published, the
original of which is in the State-Paper Office. The
epistle is penned to Henry the Eighth's minister,
Thomas Cromwell.</p>

<p class="center">"Jesus.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Offering humbly salutacyon with dew reverance.

<p>Literary physicians have, as a rule, not prospered
as medical practitioners. The public harbour towards
them the same suspicious and unfavourable prejudices
as they do to literary barristers. A man, it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
presumed, cannot be a master of two trades at the
same time, and where he professes to carry on two it
is usually concluded that he understands neither.
To display the injustice of such views is no part of
this writer's work, for the task is in better hands—time
and experience, who are yearly adding to the
cases that support the converse proposition that if a
man is really a proficient in one subject, the fact is of
itself a reason for believing him a master of a second.</p>

<p>Still, the number of brilliant writers who have enrolled
themselves in the medical fraternity is remarkable.
If they derived no benefit from their order,
they have at least generously conferred lustre upon
it. Goldsmith—though no one can say on what his
claim to the title of doctor rested, and though in his
luckless attempts to get medical employment he underwent
even more humiliation and disgrace than fell
to his lot as the drudge of Mrs. Griffiths—is one of
the most pleasant associations that our countrymen
have in connection with the history of "the Faculty."
Smollett, like Goldsmith, tried ineffectually to escape
from literary drudgery to the less irksome and more
profitable duties that surround the pestle and mortar.
Of Garth, Blackmore, Arbuthnot, and Akenside,
notice has already been taken.</p>

<p>Anything like a complete enumeration of medical
men who have made valuable contributions to <i>belles
lettres</i> would fill a volume, by the writing of which
very little good would be attained. By no means the
least of them was Armstrong, whose portrait Thomson
introduced into the "Castle of Indolence."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With him was sometimes joined in silken walk<br></span>
<span class="i1">(Profoundly silent—for they never spoke),<br></span>
<span class="i0">One shyer still, who quite detested talk;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i1">If stung by spleen, at once away he broke<br></span>
<span class="i1">To grove of pine and broad o'ershadowing oak.<br></span>
<span class="i0">There, inly thrilled, he wandered all alone,<br></span>
<span class="i1">And on himself his pensive fury woke:<br></span>
<span class="i0">He never uttered word, save when first shone<br></span>
<span class="i0">The glittering star of eve—'Thank Heaven, the day is done.'"<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>His medical writings, and his best known poem,
"The Art of Health," had he written nothing else,
would in all probability have brought him patients,
but the licentiousness of "The Economy of Love"
effectually precluded him from ever succeeding as a
family physician. Amongst Armstrong's poet
friends was Grainger, the amiable and scholarly physician
who enjoyed the esteem of Percy and Samuel
Johnson, Shenstone and Sir Joshua. Soon after the
publication of his translation of the "Elegies of
Tibullus," (1758), Grainger went to the island of St.
Christopher's, and established himself there as a
physician. The scenery and industrial occupations
of the island inspired him to write his most important
poem, "The Sugar-Cane," which, in escaping such
derision as was poured on Blackmore's effusions,
owed its good fortune to the personal popularity of
the author rather than its intrinsic merits. The following
sample is a fair one:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Destructive on the upland groves<br></span>
<span class="i0">The monkey nation preys: from rocky heights,<br></span>
<span class="i0">In silent parties they descend by night,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And posting watchful sentinels, to warn<br></span>
<span class="i0">When hostile steps approach, with gambols they<br></span>
<span class="i0">Pour o'er the cane-grove. Luckless he to whom<br></span>
<span class="i0">That land pertains! in evil hour, perhaps,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And thoughtless of to-morrow, on a die<br></span>
<span class="i0">He hazards millions; or, perhaps, reclines<br></span>
<span class="i0">On luxury's soft lap, the pest of wealth;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, inconsiderate, deems his Indian crops<br></span>
<span class="i0">Will amply her insatiate wants supply.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">"From these insidious droles (peculiar pest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span><br></span>

<span class="i0">Thy waving wealth, in traps put not thy trust,<br></span>

<span class="i0">The peaceable American's domains,<br></span>

<span class="i0">No sooner Albion's martial sons advanc'd,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Than the gay dastards to their forests fled,<br></span>

</div></div>

<p>When the poem was read in MS. at Sir Joshua's
house, the lines printed in italics were not part of the
production, but in their place stood—</p>

<p class="center">
"Now, Muse, let's sing of <i>rats</i>."<br>
</p>

<p>The immediate effect of such <i>bathos</i> was a burst of
inextinguishable laughter from the auditors, whose
sense of the ridiculous was by no means quieted by
the fact that one of the company, slyly overlooking
the reader, discovered that "the word had originally
been <i>mice</i>, and had been altered to <i>rats</i>, as more dignified."</p>

<p>Above the crowd of minor medical <i>litterateurs</i> are
conspicuous, Moore, the author of "Zeluco"; Dr.
Aikin, one of whose many works has been already referred
to; Erasmus Darwin, author of "The Botanic
Garden"; Mason Good, the translator of "Lucretius,"
and author of the "Study of Medicine"; Dr.
Ferriar, whose "Illustrations of Sterne" just doubled
the value in the market of "Burton's Anatomy of
Melancholy"; Cogan, the author of "Life and Opinions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
of John Buncle, jun."; Dr. Harrington, of Bath,
editor of the "Nugæ Antiquæ"; Millingen, who
wrote "The Curiosities of Medical Practice," and
"The History of Duelling"; Dr. Paris, whose "Life
of Sir Humphrey Davy," unsatisfactory as it is in
many places, is still a useful book, and many of whose
other writings will long remain of great value; Wadd,
the humourous collector of "Medical Ana"; Dr. Merriman,
the late contributor to the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>
and <i>Notes and Queries</i>; and Pettigrew, the
biographer of Lettsom. If the physicians and surgeons
still living, who have openly or anonymously
written with good effect on subjects not immediately
connected with their profession, were placed before
the reader, there would be found amongst them many
of the most distinguished of their fraternity.</p>

<p><i>Apropos</i> of the Dr. Harrington mentioned above, a
writer says—"The Doctor for many years attended
the Dowager Lady Trevor, relict of Lord Trevor, and
last surviving daughter of Sir Richard Steele. He
spoke of this lady as possessing all the wit, humour,
and gaiety of her father, together with most of his
faults. She was extravagant, and always in debt;
but she was generous, charitable, and humane. She
was particularly partial to young people, whom she
frequently entertained most liberally, and delighted
them with the pleasantry and volubility of her discourse.
Her person was like that which her pleasant
father described himself in the <i>Spectator</i>, with his
short face, &amp;c. A little before her death (which was
in the month of December) she sent for her doctor,
and, on his entering her chamber, he said, 'How fares
your Ladyship!' She replied, 'Oh, my dear Doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
ill fare! I am going to break up before the holidays!'
This agreeable lady lived many years in
Queen's Square, Bath, and, in the summer months, at
St. Ann's Hill, Surrey, the late residence of Rt. Hon.
Chas. James Fox."</p>

<p>Wolcot, better known as Peter Pindar, was a medical
practitioner, his father and many of his ancestors
having followed the same calling in Devonshire
and Cornwall, under the names of Woolcot, Wolcott,
Woolacot, Walcot, or Wolcot. After acquiring a
knowledge of his profession in a somewhat irregular
manner Wolcot found a patron in Sir William Trelawny,
Bart., of Trelawny, co. Cornwall, who, on going
out to assume the governorship of Jamaica, took
the young surgeon with him to act as medical officer
to his household. In Jamaica Wolcot figured in more
characters than one. He was the governor's grand-master
of the ceremonies, private secretary, and chaplain.
When the King of the Mosquitoes waited on
the new governor to express his loyal devotion to the
King of England's representative, Wolcot had to entertain
the royal guest—no difficult task as long as
strong drink was in the way.</p>

<p>His Majesty—an enormously stout black brute—regarded
intoxication as the condition of life most
fit for kings.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Champagne the courtier drinks, the spleen to chase,<br></span>
<span class="i0">The colonel Burgundy, and port his Grace."</span>
</div>

<p>The autocrat of the Mosquitoes, as the greatest only
are, in his simplicity sublime, was contented with
rum or its equivalent.</p>

<p>"Mo' drink for king! Mo' drink for king!" he
would bellow, dancing round the grand-master of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
governor's household.</p>

<p>"King," the grand-master would reply, "you are
drunk already."</p>

<p>"No, no; king no drunk. Mo' drink for king!
Broder George" (<i>i. e.</i> George III.) "love drink!"</p>

<p><i>Grand-Master.</i>—"Broder George does not love
drink: he is a sober man."</p>

<p><i>Autocrat.</i>—"But King of Musquito love drink.
Me will have mo' drink. Me love drink like devil.
Me drink whole ocean!"</p>

<p>The different meagre memoirs of Peter Pindar are
conflicting as to whether he ever received ordination
from the hands of the Bishop of London. It seems
most probable that he never did. But, consecrated or
not, there is no doubt that he officiated as a colonial
rector for some time. Droll stories of him as a parish
priest used to circulate amongst his friends, as well
as amongst his enemies. He read prayers and
preached whenever a congregation appeared in his
church, but three Sundays out of every four not a
soul came to receive the benefit of his ministrations.</p>

<p>The rector was an admirable shot, and on his way
from his house to church used to amuse himself with
shooting pigeons, his clerk—also an excellent shot—walking
behind with a fowling-piece in his hand,
and taking part in the sport. Having reached the
sacred edifice, his reverence and attendant opened
the church door and waited in the porch ten minutes
for the advent of worshippers. If none had presented
themselves at the end of ten minutes, the pastor
beat a retreat. If only a few black Christians straggled
up, the rector bought them off with a few coins
and then went home. One cunning old negro, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
saw that the parson's heart was more with the wild-fowl
of the neighboring bay than bent on the discharge
of his priestly functions, after a while presented
himself every Sunday, when the following interview
and arrangement were regularly repeated:—</p>

<p>"What do you come here for, blackee?" the parson
would exclaim.</p>

<p>"Why, massa, to hear your good sermon and all
de prayer ob de church."</p>

<p>"Would not a <i>bit</i> or two do you more good?"</p>

<p>"Yes, massa doctor—me lub prayer much, but me
lub money too."</p>

<p>The "bit or two" would then be paid, and the devotee
would retire speedily from the scene. For an
entire twelve-month was this <i>black</i>-mail exacted.</p>

<p>On his return to England, Wolcot, after a few unsuccessful
attempts to establish himself in practice,
relinquished the profession of physic as well as that
of divinity, and, settling himself in London, made
both fame and a good income by his writings. As a
political satirist he was in his day almost without a
rival, and the popularity of his numerous works
would have placed a prudent man in lasting affluence.
Improvidence, however, necessitated him to
sell the copyright of his works to Messrs. Robinson,
Golding, and Walker for an annuity of £250, payable
half-yearly, during the remainder of his life.
Loose agreements have always been the fashion between
authors and publishers, and in the present case
it was not clearly stated what "copyright of his
works" meant. The publishers interpreted it as the
copyright of both what the author had written at
the time of making the agreement, and also of what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
he should subsequently write. Wolcot, however, declared
that he had in the transaction only had regard
to his prior productions. After some litigation and
more squabbling, the publishers consented to take
Wolcot's view of the case; but he never forgave them
the discomfort they had caused him. His rancour
against "the trade" increased with time, and inspired
some of his most violent and unjust verses:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Fired with the love of rhyme, and, let me say,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Or virtue, too, I sound the moral lay;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Much like St. Paul (who solemnly protests<br></span>
<span class="i0">He battled hard at Ephesus with beasts),<br></span>
<span class="i0">I've fought with lions, monkeys, bulls, and bears,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And got half Noah's ark about my ears;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, more (which all the courts of justice know),<br></span>
<span class="i0">Fought with the brutes of Paternoster Row."</span>
</div>

<p>For medicine Peter Pindar had even less respect
than Garth had. He used to say "that he did not
like the practice of it as an art. He was entirely ignorant,
indeed, whether the patient was cured by
the vis <i>medicatrix naturæ</i>, or the administration of a
little pill, which was either directly or indirectly to
reach the part affected." And for the practitioners
of the art held in such low esteem, he cherished a
contempt that he would at times display with true
Pindaric warmth. In his two-act farce, "Physic
and Delusion; or Jezebel and the Doctors," the dialogue
is carried on in the following strain:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Blister.</i>—&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;    By God, old prig!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Another word, and by my wig——<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Bolus.</i>—Thy wig? Great accoucheur, well said,<br></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis of more value than thy head;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And 'mongst thy customers—poor ninnies!<br></span>
<span class="i0">Has helped thee much to bag thy guineas."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Amongst Peter Pindar's good services to the world
was the protection he afforded to Opie (or Oppy, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
it was at one time less euphoniously spelt and pronounced)
the artist, when he was a poor country
clown, rising at three o'clock in the summer mornings,
to pursue his art with rude pieces of chalk and
charcoal. Wolcot presented the boy with his first
pencils, colours, and canvas, and put him in the
way to paint portraits for the magnificent remuneration
of half-a-guinea, and subsequently a guinea
a-head. And it was to the same judicious friend that
Opie, on leaving the provinces, owed his first success
in London.</p>

<p>Wolcot used to tell some droll stories about his
artist friend. Opie's indiscreet manner was a source
of continual trouble to those who endeavoured to
serve him; for, priding himself on being "a rough
diamond," he took every pains that no one should
fail to see the roughness. A lady sitter was anxious
that her portrait should be "very handsome," and
frankly told the painter so. "Then, madam," was
the reply, "you wish to be painted otherwise than
you are. I see you do not want your own face."
Not less impudent was he at the close of his first year
in London, in taking out writs against several sitters
who were rather tardy in their payments.</p>

<p>Opie was not the only artist of celebrity deeply indebted
to Peter Pindar. Bone, the painter in enamel,
found an efficient friend in the same discerning lover
of the arts. In this respect Wolcot was worthy of
the profession which he deserted, and affected to despise;
and his name will ever be honourably mentioned
amongst those physicians who have fostered
art, from the days of picture-loving Mead, down to
those of the writer's very kind friend, Dr. Diamond,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
who gathered from remote quarters "The Diamond
Collection of Portraits," which may be seen amongst
the art treasures of Oxford.</p>

<p>One of the worthies of Dr. Diamond's family was
Robertus Fludd, or De Fluctibus, the writer of Rosicrucian
celebrity who gave Sterne more than one
lesson in the arts of eccentricity. Sir Thomas Fludd
of Milgate, Bearsted, co. Kent (grandson of David
Fludd, <i>alias</i> Lloyd of Morton, in Shropshire), had
five sons and a daughter. Of this offspring, one son,
Thomas, purchased Gore Court, and fixed there a
family, the vicissitudes of which may be learnt by a
reference to Hasted's Kent. From this branch of
the Fludds descended Dr. Diamond, who, amongst
other curious family relics, possesses the diploma of
Robertus de Fluctibus.</p>

<p>When Robertus de Fluctibus died, Sept. 8, 1637,
in Coleman St., London, his body, under the protection
of a herald of arms, was conveyed to the family
seat in Kent, and was then buried in Bearsted
Church, under a stone which he had before laid for
himself. The monument over his ashes was ordered
by him in his last will to be made after that of William
Camden in the Abbey at Westminster. The inscription
which marks his resting-place declares his,
rather than our, estimate of his intellectual greatness;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">Magnificus non hæc sub odoribus urna vaporat,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Crypta tegit cineres nec speciosa tuos.<br></span>

<p>More modest, and at the same time more humorous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
is the epitaph, in Hendon Church, of poor Thomas
Crossfield, whose name, alike as surgeon and politician,

<p>Amongst the medical poets there is one whom all
scholarly physicians jealously claim as of their body—John
Keats; he who, dying at Rome, at the age of
twenty-six, wished his epitaph to be, "Here lies one
whose name was writ in water." After serving his
apprenticeship under an Edmonton surgeon, the
author of "Endymion" became a medical student at
St. Thomas's hospital.</p>

<p>Mention here, too, may be made of Dr. Macnish, the
author of "The Anatomy of Drunkenness," and
"The Modern Pythagorean"; and of Dr. Moir, the
poet, whose death, a few years since, robbed the
world of a simple and pathetic writer, and his personal
acquaintance of a noble-hearted friend.</p>

<p>But of all modern English poets who have had an
intimate personal connection with the medical profession,
the greatest by far is Crabbe—</p>

<p class="center">
"Nature's sternest painter, yet the best."<br>
</p>

<p>In 1754 George Crabbe was born in the old sea-faring
town of Aldborough, in the county of Suffolk.
His father, the collector of salt-duties, or salt-master
of the town, was a churlish sullen fellow at the best
of times; but, falling upon adversity in his old days,
he became the <i>beau-ideal</i> of a domestic tyrant. He
was not, however, without his respectable points.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
Though a poor man, he did his best to educate his
children above the ranks of the very poor. One of
them became a thriving glazier in his native town;
another went to sea, and became captain of a Liverpool
slave-ship; and a third, also a sailor, met with
strange vicissitudes—at one time enjoying a very
considerable amount of prosperity, and then suffering
penury and persecution. A studious and a delicate
lad, George, the eldest of the party, was designed
for some pursuit more adapted to his disposition and
physical powers than the avocations of working mechanics,
or the hard duties of the marine service.
When quite a child, he had, amongst the inhabitants
of Aldborough, a reputation for mental superiority
that often did him good service. On one occasion he
chanced to offend a playmate—his senior and "master,"
as boys and savages term it—and was on the
point of receiving a good thrashing nigh the roaring
waves of old ocean, when a third boy, a common acquaintance,
exclaimed in a voice of affright:—</p>

<p>"Yar marn't middle a' him; lit him aloone—he ha'
got l'arning."</p>

<p>The plea was admitted as a good one, and the future
bard, taking his benefit of clergy, escaped the
profanation of a drubbing.</p>

<p>George was sent to two respectable schools, the one
at Bungay, in Suffolk, and the other (the better of
the two) at Stowmarket, in the same county. The
expense of such an education, even if it amounted
to no more than £20 per annum, was no small undertaking
for the salt-master of a fishing-village; for
Aldborough—now a handsome and much frequented
provincial watering-place—was in 1750 nothing better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
than a collection of huts, whose humble inhabitants
possessed little stake in the commonweal beyond
the right of sending to parliament two members to
represent their interests and opinions. On leaving
school, in his fourteenth year, George was apprenticed
to a country doctor of a very rough sort, who
plied his trade at Wickham Brook, a small village
near Bury St. Edmunds. It is a fact worthy of note,
as throwing some light on the state of the profession
in the provinces, that the apprentice shared the bed
of his master's stable-boy. At Wickham Brook, however,
the lad did not remain long to endure such indignity.
He was removed from that scene of trial,
and placed under the tutelage of Mr. Page, a surgeon
of Woodbridge, a gentleman of good connections and
polite tastes, and through the marriage of his daughter
with the late famous Alderman Wood, an ancestor
of a learned judge, who is not more eminent as
a lawyer than beloved as a man.</p>

<p>It was during his apprenticeship to Mr. Page of
Woodbridge that Crabbe made his first important
efforts in poetry, publishing, in the year 1772, some
fugitive pieces in <i>Wheble's Magazine</i>, and in 1775
"Inebriety, a poem, in three parts. Ipswich: printed
and sold by C. Punchard, bookseller, in the Butter-market."
While at Woodbridge, too, his friend Levett,
a young surgeon of the neighborhood, took him
over to Framlingham, introducing him to the families
of that picturesque old town. William Springall
Levett was at that time engaged to Alethea Brereton,
a lady who, under the <i>nom de plume</i> of "Eugenia
Acton," wrote certain novels that created a sensation
in their brief day. Amongst them were "Vicissitudes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
of Genteel Life," "The Microcosm," and "A Tale
without a Title." The love-making of Mr. Levett and
Miss Eugenia de Acton was put a stop to by the
death of the former, in 1774. The following epitaph,
transcribed from the History of Framlingham, the
work of the able antiquarian, Mr. Richard Green, is
interesting as one of Crabbe's earlier compositions.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"What! though no trophies peer above his dust,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sculptured conquests deck his sober bust;<br></span>
<span class="i0">What! though no earthly thunders sound his name,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Death gives him conquest, and our sorrows fame!<br></span>
<span class="i0">One sigh reflection heaves, but shuns excess,<br></span>
<span class="i0">More should we mourn him, did we love him less."</span>
</div>

<p>Subsequently Miss Brereton married a gentleman
named Lewis, engaged in extensive agricultural operations.
However brief her literary reputation may
have been, her pen did her good service; for, at a
critical period of her husband's career, it brought
her sums of much-needed money.</p>

<p>Mr. Levett's romance closed prematurely together
with his life, but through him Crabbe first became
acquainted with the lovely girl whom he loved
through years of trial, and eventually made his wife.
Sarah Elmy was the niece of John Tovell, <i>yeoman</i>,
not <i>gentleman</i>—he would have scorned the title. Not
that the worthy man was without pride of divers
kinds, or that he did not hold himself to be a gentleman.
He believed in the Tovells as being one of the
most distinguished families of the country. A Tovell,
by mere right of being a Tovell, could thrash
more Frenchmen than any Englishman, not a Tovell,
could. When the good man said, "I am nothing
more than a plain yeoman," he never intended or expected
any one to believe him, or to regard his words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
in any other light than as a playful protest against
being deemed "a plain yeoman," or that modern hybrid,
"a gentleman farmer."</p>

<p>He was a well-made, handsome, pleasant fellow—riding
a good horse with the hounds—loving good
cheer—enjoying laughter, without being very particular
as to the cause of it—a little too much addicted
to carousing, but withal an agreeable and useful
citizen; and he lived at Parham Lodge, a house
that a peer inhabited after him, without making any
important alterations in the place.</p>

<p>On Crabbe's first introduction to Parham Lodge
he was received with cordiality; but when it was seen
that he had fallen in love with the squire's niece, it
was only natural that "his presumption" should not
at first meet the approval either of Mrs. Tovell or her
husband. But the young people plighted troth to
each other, and the engagement was recognized by
the lady's family. It was years, however, before the
wedding bells were set ringing. Crabbe's apprenticeship
to Mr. Page finished, he tried ineffectually to
raise the funds for a regular course of hospital instruction
in London. Returning to Aldborough, he
furnished a shop with a few bottles and a pound's
worth of drugs, and set up as "an apothecary." Of
course it was only amongst the poor of his native
town that he obtained patients, the wealthier inhabitants
of the borough distrusting the knowledge of a
doctor who had not walked the hospitals. In the
summer of 1778, however, he was appointed surgeon
to the Warwickshire militia, then stationed at Aldborough,
and in the following winter, on the Warwickshire
militia being moved and replaced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
Norfolk militia, he was appointed surgeon to the latter
regiment also. But these posts were only temporary,
and conferred but little emolument on their
holder. At length poverty drove the poet from his
native town. The rest of his career is matter of notoriety.
Every reader knows how the young man
went to London and only escaped the death of Otway
or Chatterton by the generous patronage of Burke,
how through Burke's assistance he was ordained, became
the Duke of Rutland's chaplain, obtained comfortable
church preferment, and for a long span enjoyed
an amount of domestic happiness that was as
great and richly deserved as his literary reputation.</p>

<p>Crabbe's marriage with Sarah Elmy eventually
conferred on him and his children the possession of
Parham Lodge, which estate, a few years since, passed
from them into the hands of wealthy purchasers.
The poet also succeeded to other wealth through the
same connection, an old-maid sister of John Tovell
leaving him a considerable sum of money. "I can
screw Crabbe up and down like an old fiddle," this
amiable lady was fond of saying; and during her
life she proved that her boast was no empty one.
But her will was a handsome apology for all her little
tiffs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<h3>NUMBER ELEVEN—A HOSPITAL STORY.</h3>


<p>"Then, sir," said Mrs. Mallet, "if you'll only not
look so frightened, I'll tell you how it was. It is now
twenty years ago that I was very unfortunate. I
was not more than thirty years of age, but I was old
enough to have just lost a good husband and a dear
little babe; and then, when I hadn't a sixpence in
my pocket, I caught the fever, and had to go to a
hospital. I wasn't used to trouble; for although I
was nothing better than a poor man's child, I had
known all my life nothing but kindness. I never
had but one mistress,—my lady, who when she was
the most beautiful young lady in all Devonshire, took
me out of a village school, and raised me to be her
maid; and her maid I was for twelve years—first
down in Devonshire, and afterwards up in London,
when she married (somewhat against the will of her
family) a thorough good gentleman, but a poor one,
who after a time took her out to India, where he became
a judge, and she a grand lady. My dear mistress
would have taken me out to India with her, only
she was then too poor to pay for my passage out, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
bear the expense of me there, where labour can be
got so cheap, and native servants can live on a handful
of rice a day. She, sir, is Lady Burridge—the
same who gave me the money to start in this house
with, and whose carriage you saw yesterday at my
door.</p>

<p>"So my mistress went eastward, and I was left
behind to marry a young man I had loved for some
few years, and who had served during that time as
clerk to my lady's husband. I was a young woman,
and young women, to the end of the chapter, will
think it a brave thing to fall in love. I thought my
sweetheart was a handsomer and cleverer man than
any other of his station in all London. I wonder
how many girls have thought the same of their favourites!
I went to church one morning with a fluttering
heart and trembling knees, and came out under
the porch thinking that all my life would ever
afterwards be brighter, and lighter, and sunnier than
it had been before. Well! in dancing into that pretty
blunder, I wasn't a bigger fool than lots of others.</p>

<p>"And if a good husband is a great blessing (and
she must be a paltry woman who can say nay to that),
I was born to luck; for my husband was kind, good,
and true—his temper was as sweet at home as his
manners were abroad—he was hard-working and
clever, sober and devout; and—though you may
laugh at a woman of my age talking so like a romance—I
tell you, sir, that if my life had to come all over
again, I'd rather have the mischance of marrying
my dear Richard, that the good fortune of wedding a
luckier man.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt the game turned out ill for me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
At first it seemed as if it would be just otherwise, for
my husband had good health, plenty of work, and
sufficient pay; so that, when my little girl came, her
sweet face brought no shadow of anxiety with it, and
we hoped she would be followed in due course by
half-a-dozen more. But ere the dear babe had learned
to prattle, a drear change came over the happy prospect.
The fever crept over the gentle darling, and
after she had suffered for a week or more, lying on
my arms, God raised her from me into his happy
home, where the beauty of summer reigns for ever,
and the coldness of winter never enters. Richard
and I took the body of our babe to the burial-ground,
and saw it covered up in the earth which by turns
gives all we get, and takes away from us all we have;
and as we walked back to our deserted home, arm-in-arm,
in the light of the summer's evening, we
talked to each other more solemnly and tenderly than
we had done for many a day. And the next morning
he went back to his work in the office, from which he
had absented himself since our child's death; and I
encouraged him to cheer up, and not to give way to
sorrow when I was not nigh to comfort him, but toil
bravely and hopefully, as a man should; and in so
advising him, I do not blush to say that I thought
not only of what was best for his spirits, but also
of what our necessity required—for we were only
poor people, not at any time beforehand in the world,
and now reduced by the cost of our little one's illness
and funeral; and, sir, in this hard world we women,
most times, have the best of it, for when the house
is full of sorrow, we have little else to do but weep,
but the men have to grieve and toil too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>"But poor Richard could not hold up his head.
He came back from work that day pale and faint,
and in the evening he had a chill and a heat-fit, that
let me know the fever which had killed our little one
had passed into him. The next day he could not
leave his bed, and the doctor (a most kind man, who
was always making rough jokes in a rough voice—just
to hide his womanliness) said to me, 'If your
husband goes down to his master's chambers in the
Temple to-day, he had better stop at the coffin-maker's,
in the corner of Chancery Lane, and leave his
measure.' But Richard's case was not one for a jest,
and he rapidly became worse than the doctor fancied
he would be when he made that light speech. He
was ill for six weeks, and then began slowly to mend;
he got on so far as to sit up for two days for half-an-hour
while he had his tea, and we were hoping
that soon he would be able to be moved into the country—to
my sister's, whose husband was an engineer
at Stratford; but, suddenly, he had a relapse, and on
the morning that finished the tenth week from his
being seized, his arms let go their hold on my neck—and
I was left alone!</p>

<p>"All during my babe's and Richard's long illness
my sister Martha had behaved like a true sister to
me. She was my only sister, and, to the best of my
knowledge, the only relation I had in the world—and
a good one she was; from girl to woman her heart
always rung out clear like a bell. She had three
young children, but even fear of contagion reaching
them could not keep her from me in my trouble. She
kept making the journey backwards and forwards,
at least once a week, in the carrier's cart; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
though she had no money to spare, she brought me,
with her husband's blessing, presents of wine, and
jellies, and delicate meat, to buy which, I knew right
well, she and her husband and her children must
have pinched themselves down to scanty rations of
bread and water. Her hands helped mine to put the
flowers in poor Richard's coffin; she bore me up while
I followed it, pale and trembling, to the grave; and
when that horrible day was coming to an end, and
she was about to return home, she took me into her
arms, and covering me with kisses and caressings,
and a thousand gentle sayings, as if I had been a
child of her own, instead of her sister and a grown
woman, she made me promise to come down to her
at Stratford at the end of the week, and stay with
her till God should give me strength and spirits and
guidance, to work for myself again.</p>

<p>"But that promise was not kept. Next morning
the rough-tender doctor came in, out of his mere
goodness, to give me a friendly look, and a 'God
speed you,' and found me, too, sickening for an illness.
I knew, sir, he had made the discovery before
his lips confessed a word; for when he had taken my
wrist and felt my pulse, and looked up into my worn
face, he turned pale, as if almost frightened, and
such a look of grief came on his eyes and lips that
he could not have said plainer, 'My poor woman! my
poor woman! what I feared from the beginning, and
prayed God not to permit, has come to pass at last.'</p>

<p>"Then I fairly broke down and cried bitterly; and
I told the doctor how sore afflicted I was—how God
had taken my husband and babe from me—how all
my little means had been consumed in the expenses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
of nursing—how the little furniture in my rooms
would not pay half what I owed to honest folk—and
how, even in my unspeakable wretchedness, I could
not ask the Almighty to take away my life, for I
could not rest in death if I left the world without
paying my just debts. Well, sir, the doctor sate down
by me, and said, in his softest and simplest way:—</p>

<p>"'Come, come, neighbour, don't you frighten
yourself. Be calm, and listen to me. Don't let the
thought of debts worry you. What little I have done
in the way of business for your poor child and husband
I never wish to be paid for—so there's your
greatest creditor disposed of. As for the others,
they won't trouble you, for I'll undertake to see that
none of them shall think that you have wronged 'em.
I wish I could do more, neighbor; but I ain't a rich
man, and I have got a wife and a regiment of little
ones at home, who won't help, in the long run, to
make me richer—although I am sure they'll make
me happier. But now for yourself; you must go to
the fever-hospital, to have your illness out; the physician
who'll take care of you there is the cleverest
in all London; and, as he is an old friend of mine,
I can ask him to pay especial attention to you. You'll
find it a pleasant, cheerful place, much more cool and
comfortable than your rooms here; the nurses are all
of them good people; and while lying on your bed
there you won't have to fret yourself with thinking
how you are to pay for the doctors, and medicine,
and kitchen physic.'</p>

<p>"I was only too thankful to assent to all the doctor
said; and forthwith he fetched a coach, put me
into it, and took me off to the fever-hospital, to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
his influence procured me instant admittance. Without
delay I was conveyed to a large and comfortable
bed, which, with another similar bed parallel to it,
was placed against the wall at the end of a long gallery,
containing twenty other beds. The first day of
my hospital life I spent tranquilly enough; the languor
of extreme exhaustion had soothed me, and my
malady had not robbed me of my senses. So I lay
calmly on my couch and watched all the proceedings
and arrangements of the great bed-room. I noticed
how clean and white all the beds looked, and what
kindly women the nurses were; I remarked what a
wide space there was down the middle of the room
between the two rows of beds, and again what large
intervals there were between the beds on each side;
I observed, too, that over every bed there was a ventilator
set in the wall, and beneath the ventilator a
board, on which was pinned a paper, bearing, in a
filled-up printed form, the number of the bed to
which it belonged, the date when the occupant was
admitted to the ward, the names of the physician
and nurse under whose charge she was, the medicine
she was taking, and the diet on which she was put.
It made me smile, moreover, to note how the nurses,
when giving physic or nourishment, or otherwise attending
to their charges, would frequently address
them by the numbers on their boards, instead of their
names.</p>

<p>"'Nurse, dear,' I asked, with a smile, when my
attendant came near me, 'what's my name?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, dear!' said she, looking up at the board
which had already been fixed over my head, 'your
name is Number Eleven.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>"It would be hard for me to give you, sir, any notion
of how these words, <i>Number Eleven</i>, took possession
of my mind. This was the more strange, because
the nurse did not usually call me by them; for
she was a motherly creature, and almost always addressed
me as 'poor dear,' or 'poor child'; and the
doctors who had the charge of me spoke to me as
'friend,' or 'old friend,' or 'neighbor.' But all the
same for that, I always thought of myself as Number
Eleven; and ere many days, if any one had asked
me what my name was, I could not for the life of
me have remembered Abigail Mallet, but should have
answered Number Eleven. The patient in the next
bed to me was Number Twenty-two; she was, like
myself, a poor woman who had just lost a husband
and child by the fever, and both of us were much
struck, and then drawn to each other, by discovering
how we had suffered alike. We often interchanged
a few words during the sorrowful hours of
the long, hot nights, but our whisperings always
turned on the same subject. 'Number Eleven,' I
used to hear her poor thin lips murmur, 'are you
thinking of your baby, dear?' 'To be sure, darling,'
I would answer; 'I am awake, and when I am awake,
I am always thinking of her.' Then most times she
would inquire, 'Number Eleven, dear, which do you
think of most—the little one or her father?' Whereto
I would reply, 'I think of both alike, dear, for
whenever I look at her, a fair young angel in heaven—she
seems to be lying in her father's arms.' And
after we had conversed so, No. 22 would be quiet for
a few minutes; and often, in the silence of the night,
I could at such times hear that which informed me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
the poor woman was weeping to herself—in such a
way that she was happier for her tears.</p>

<p>"But my malady progressed unfavourably. Each
succeeding night was worse to endure; and the morning
light, instead of bringing refreshment and hope,
only gave to me a dull, gloomy consciousness that I
had passed hours in delirium, and that I was weaker
and heavier in heart, and more unlikely than ever to
hold my head up again. They cut all the hair off my
head, and put blisters at the back of my neck; but
the awful weight of sorrow and the gnawing heat
kept on my brain all the same. I could no longer
amuse myself with looking at what went on in the
ward; I lost all care for the poor woman who lay in
the next bed; and soon I tossed to and fro, and
heeded nothing of the outer world except the burning,
and aching, and thirst, and sleeplessness that
encased me.</p>

<p>"One morning I opened my eyes and saw the doctor
standing between me and No. 22, talking to the
nurse. A fit of clearness passed over my understanding,
such as people suffering under fever often
experience for a few seconds, and I heard the physician
say softly to the nurses, 'We must be careful
and do our best, sister, and leave the rest to God.
They are both very ill; this is now the fourth day
since either of them recognized me. They must have
more wine and brandy to help them through. Here,
give me their boards.' On this, the nurse took down
the boards, and handed them, one after the other, to
the physician, and he, taking a pen from a clerk,
who always attended him, wrote his directions on the
papers, and handed them back to the nurse. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
heard and seen all this, I shifted in my bed, and after
a few weak efforts to ponder on my terrible condition,
and how awful a thing it is to die, I fell back
into my former state of delirium and half-consciousness.</p>

<p>"The next distinct memory I have of my illness
was when I opened my eyes and beheld a wooden
screen standing between me and the next bed. My
head felt as if it had been put into a closely fitting
cap of ice; but apart from this strange sensation, I
was free from pain. My body was easy, and my
mind was tranquil. My nurse was standing at the
foot of my bed, looking towards me with an expression
of solemn tenderness; and by her side was another
woman—as I afterwards found out, a new
nurse, unaccustomed to the ways of the hospital.</p>

<p>"'What is that screen there for?' asked the novice.</p>

<p>"My nurse lowered her voice, and answered slowly,
'Number Eleven, poor soul, is dying; she'll be
dead in half an hour; and the screen is there so that
Number Twenty-Two mayn't see her.'</p>

<p>"'Poor soul!' said the novice, 'may God have mercy
upon her!'</p>

<p>"They spoke scarcely above a whisper, but I heard
them distinctly; and a solemn gladness, such as I
used to feel, when I was a young girl, at the sound
of church music, came over me at learning that I
was to die. Only half an hour, and I should be with
baby and Richard in heaven! Mixed with this
thought, too, there was a pleasant memory of those
I had loved and who had loved me—of sister Martha
and her husband and children, of the doctor who
had been so good to me and brought me to the hospital,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
of my lady in India, of many others; and I
silently prayed the Almighty with my dying heart
to protect and bless them. Then passed through me
a fluttering of strange, soft fancies, and it was revealed
to me that I was dead.</p>

<p>"By-and-by the physician came his round of the
ward, stepping lightly, pausing at each bed, speaking
softly to nurses and patients, and, without knowing
it, making many a poor woman entertain kinder
thoughts than she had ever meant to cherish of the
wealthy and gentle. When he came to the end of
the ward, his handsome face wore a pitiful air, and
it was more by the movement of his lips than by the
sound of his mouth that I knew what passed from
him to the nurse.</p>

<p>"'Well, sister, well,' he said, 'she sleeps quietly at
last. Poor thing! I hope and believe the next life
will be a fairer one for her than this has been.'</p>

<p>"'Her sister has been written to,' observed the
nurse.</p>

<p>"'Quite right; and how is the other?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, No. 22 is just the same—quite still, not moving
at all, scarcely breathing, sir!'</p>

<p>"'Um!—you must persevere. Possibly she'll pull
through. Good-bye, sister.'</p>

<p>"Late in the evening my sister Martha came. She
was dressed in black, and led with her hand Rhoda,
her eldest daughter. Poor Martha was very pale,
and worn, and ill; when she approached the bed on
which I lay, she seemed as if she would faint, and she
trembled so painfully that my kind nurse led her
behind the screen, so that she might recover herself
out of my sight. After a few seconds—say two minutes—she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
stood again at the foot of my bed—calmer,
but with tears in her eyes, and such a mournful loveliness
in her sweet face as I had never seen before.</p>

<p>"'I shouldn't have known her, nurse,' she said,
gazing at me for a short space and then withdrawing
her eyes—'she is so much altered.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, dear!' answered the nurse, 'sickness alters
people much—and death more.'</p>

<p>"'I know it, nurse—I know it. And she looks
very calm and blissful—her face is so full of rest—so
full of rest!'</p>

<p>"The nurse fetched some seats, and made Martha
and Rhoda sit down side by side; and then the good
woman stood by them, ready to afford them all comfort
in her power.</p>

<p>"'How did she bear her illness?' inquired Martha.</p>

<p>"'Like an angel, dear,' answered the nurse. 'She
had a sweet, grateful, loving temper. Whatever I
did for her, even though my duty compelled me to
give her pain, she was never fretful, but always concealed
her anguish and said, "Thank you, dear, thank
you, you are very good; God will reward you for
all your goodness"; and as the end came nigher I
often fancied that she had reasonable and happy
moments, for she would fold her hands together, and
say scraps of prayers which children are taught.'</p>

<p>"'Nurse,' replied my sister after a pause, 'she and
I were the only children of our father, and we were
left orphans very young. She was two years older
than I, and she always thought for me and did for
me as if she had been my mother. I could fill whole
hours with telling you all the goodness and forbearance
and love she displayed to me, from the time I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
was little or no bigger than my child here. I was
often wayward and peevish, and gave her many hours
of trouble, but though at times she could be hot to
others she never spoke an unkind word to me. There
was no sacrifice that she would not have made for me;
but all the return I ever made was to worry her with
my evil jealous temper. I was continually imagining
unchristian things against her: that she slighted me;
that, because she had a mistress who made much of
her, she didn't care for me; that she didn't think
my children fit to be proud of. And I couldn't keep
all these foolish thoughts in my head to myself, but
I must needs go and speak them out to her, and irritate
her to quarrel with me. But she always returned
smooth words to my angry ones, and I had
never a fit of my unjust temper but she charmed me
out of it, and showed me my error in such a way that
I was reproved, without too much humiliation, and
loved her more than ever. Oh! dear friend, dear
good nurse, if you have a sister, don't treat her, as
I did Abigail, with suspicion and wicked passion; for
should you, all the light speeches of your frowardness
will return to you, and lie heavy on your heart
when hers shall beat no more.'</p>

<p>"When Martha had said this she cried very bitterly;
and as I lay dead on my bed, and listened to
her unfair self-reproaches, I longed to break the icy
bonds that held me, and yearned to clasp her to my
breast. Still, though I could neither move nor utter
a sound, it thrilled me with gladness to see how she
loved me.</p>

<p>"'Mother,' said little Rhoda, softly, 'don't cry.
We shan't be long away from Aunt and her baby,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
for when this life is done we shall go to them. You
know, mother, you told me so last night.'</p>

<p>"It was not permitted to me to hear any more. A
colder chill came over my brain—and, wrapt in unconsciousness
and deep stillness, I lay upon my bed.</p>

<p>"My next recollection is of beholding the gray
dawn stream in through the half-opened windows,
and of wondering, amid vague reminiscences of my
previous sensations, how it was that a dead person
could take notice of the world it moved in when alive.
It is not enough to say that my experience of the last
repose was pleasant to me; I was rejoiced and greatly
delighted by it. Death, it seemed then, was no state
of cold decay for men to shudder at with affright—but
a condition of tranquility and mental comfort.
I continued to muse on this remarkable discovery
for an hour and more, when my favourite nurse reappeared
to relieve the woman who had taken the
night-watch, and approached me.</p>

<p>"'Ah!' she surprised me by saying, as a smile of
congratulation lighted her face, 'then you are alive
this morning, dear, and have your handsome eyes
wide open.'</p>

<p>"This in my opinion was a singularly strange and
inappropriate address; but I made no attempt to respond
to it, for I knew that I was dead. and that the
dead do not speak.</p>

<p>"'Why, dear heart,' resumed the nurse, kneeling
by my side and kissing me, 'can't you find your
tongue? I know by your eyes that you know me;
the glassy stare has left them. Come, do say a word,
and say you are better.'</p>

<p>"Then a suspicion flashed across my brain, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
raising my right hand slightly, I pointed to the bed
of No. 22, and asked, 'How is she?—how is she?'</p>

<p>"'Don't frighten yourself, dear,' answered the
nurse, 'she isn't there. She has been moved. She
doesn't have that bed my longer!'</p>

<p>"'Then it is <i>she</i> who is dead, nurse; and all the
rest was a dream? It is she who is dead?'</p>

<p>"'Hush, hush, dear! she has gone to rest—'</p>

<p>"Yes! it was all clear to me. Not I but my unfortunate
companion had died; and in my delirious
fancy I had regarded the friends who came to see
her, and convey her to the grave, as my sister Martha
and her little daughter Rhoda. I did not impart
to the nurse the delusion of which I had been
the victim; for, as is often the case with the sick, I
was sensitive with regard to the extreme mental sickness
into which I had fallen, and the vagaries of my
reason. So I kept my secret to the best of my power;
and having recognised how much better I was,
how the fever had quitted my veins and the weight
had left my head, I thanked God in my heart for all
his mercies, and once more cherished a hope that he
might see fit to restore me to health.</p>

<p>"My recovery was rapid. At the end of a fortnight
I was moved into the convalescents' ward, and
was fed up with wine and meat in abundance. I had
every reason to be thankful for all the kindness bestowed
on me in the hospital, and all the good effect
God permitted that kindness to have. But one thing
troubled me very much and cut me to the quick. Ever
since I had been in the hospital my sister had neither
been to see me, nor sent to inquire after me. It was
no very difficult business to account for her neglect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
of me. She had her good qualities (even in the height
of my anger I could not deny that), but she was of
a very proud high temper. She could sacrifice anything
but her pride for love of me. I had gone into
an hospital, had received public charity, and she hadn't
courage to acknowledge a sister who had sunk so low
as that! But if she was proud so was I; I could
be as high and haughty as she; and, what was more,
I would show her that I could be so! What, to leave
her own sister—her only sister—who had worked
for her when she was little, and who had loved
her as her own heart! I would resent it! Perhaps
fortune might yet have a turn to make in my favour;
and if so I would in my prosperity remember how
I had been treated in my adversity. I am filled with
shame now, when I think on the revengeful imaginations
which followed each other through my breast.
I am thankful that when my animosity was at its
height my sister did not present herself before me;
for had she done so, I fear that, without waiting for
an explanation from her, I should have spoken hasty
words that (however much I might have afterwards
repented them, and she forgiven them) would have
rendered it impossible for us to be again the same as
we were before. I never mentioned to any one—nurse
or patient—in the convalescent ward, the secret
of my clouded brows, or let out that I had a friend
in the world to think of me or to neglect me. Hour
after hour I listened to women and girls and young
children, talking of home pleasures and longing to be
quite well, and dismissed from the confinement of
the hospital, and anticipating the pleasure which
their husbands, or mothers, or sisters, or children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
would express at welcoming them again; but I never
gave a word of such gossip; I only hearkened, and
compared their hopes with my desolation, morosely
and vindictively. Before I was declared perfectly
restored I got very tired of my imprisonment; indeed
the whole time I was in the convalescent ward
my life was wearisome, and without any of the pleasures
which the first days of my sickness had had.
There was only one inmate of the ward to which I
was at first admitted, as yet, amongst the convalescents;
none of them knew me, unless it was by
my number—a new one now, for on changing my
ward I had changed my number also. The nurses I
didn't like so well as my first kind attendant; and
I couldn't feel charitably, or in any way as a Christian
ought to feel, to the poor people by whom I was
surrounded.</p>

<p>"At length the day came for my discharge. The
matron inquired of me where I was going; but I
would not tell her; I would not acknowledge that I
had a sister—partly out of mere perverseness, and
partly out of an angry sense of honour; for I was a
country-bred woman, and attached to the thought of
'going into a hospital' a certain idea of shame and
degradation, such as country people attach to 'going
on the parish', and I was too proud to let folk know
that my sister had a sister in an hospital, when she
clearly flinched from having as much said of her.</p>

<p>"Well, finding I was not in a communicative humour,
the matron asked no more questions; but, giving
me a bundle containing a few articles of wearing
apparel, and a small donation of money, bade me
farewell; and without saying half as much in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
way of gratitude as I ought to have said, I walked
out from the hospital garden into the wide streets of
London. I did not go straight to my old lodgings,
or to the house of the doctor who had been so kind
to me; but I directed my steps to an inn in Holborn,
and took a place in the stage-cart for Stratford. As
I rode slowly to my sister's town I thought within
myself how I should treat her. Somehow my heart
had softened a great deal towards her during the
few last days; a good spirit within me had set me
thinking of how she had helped me to nurse my husband
and baby—how she had accompanied me when
I followed them to their graves—how she and her
husband had sacrificed themselves so much to assist
me in my trial; and the recollection of these kindnesses
and proofs of sisterly love, I am thankful to
know, made me judge Martha much less harshly.
Yes! yes! I would forgive her! She had never offended
me before! She had not wronged me seven
times, or seventy times seven, but only <i>once</i>! After
all, how much she had done for me! Who was I, that
I should forget all that she had done, and judge her
only by what she had left undone?</p>

<p>"The stage-cart reached Stratford as the afternoon
began to close into evening; and when I alighted from
it, I started off at a brisk pace, and walked to my sister's
cottage that stood on the outskirts of the town.
Strange to say, as I got nearer and nearer to her
door my angry feelings became fainter and fainter,
and all my loving memories of her strong affection for
me worked so in me that my knees trembled beneath
me, and my eyes were blinded with tears—though,
if I had trusted my deceitful, wicked, malicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
tongue to speak, I should still have declared she was a
bad, heartless, worthless, sister.</p>

<p>"I reached the threshold, and paused on the step
before it, just to get my breath and to collect as
much courage and presence of mind as would let
Martha know that, though I forgave her, I still was
fully aware she might have acted more nobly. When
I knocked, after a few seconds, little Rhoda's steps
pattered down the passage, and opened the door.
Why, the child was in black! What did that mean?
Had anything happened to Martha or her husband,
or little Tommy? But before I could put the question
Rhoda turned deadly white, and ran back into the
living-room. In another instant I heard Tommy
screaming at the top of his voice; and in a trice I
was in the room, with Martha's arms flung round
my neck, and her dear blessed eyes covering me with
tears.</p>

<p>"She was very ill in appearance; white and haggard,
and, like Rhoda and Tommy, she too was dressed
in black. For some minutes she could not speak a
word for sobbing hysterically; but when at last I had
quieted her and kissed Rhoda, and cossetted Tommy
till he had left off screaming, I learnt that the mourning
Martha and her children wore was in my honour.
Sure enough Martha had received a notice from
the hospital of my death; and she and Rhoda had
not only presented themselves at the hospital, and
seen there a dead body which they believed to be
mine, but they had also, with considerable expense,
and much more loving care, had it interred in the
Stratford churchyard, under the impression that in
so doing they were offering me the last respect which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
it would be in their power to render me. The worst
of it was that poor Martha had pined and sorrowed so
for me that she seemed likely to fall into some severe
illness.</p>

<p>"On inquiry it appeared that the morning when I
and No. 22 were so much worse, and the doctor altered
the directions of our boards, the nurse by mistake
put the No. 22 board over my bed, and my board (No.
11) over the bed of the poor woman who had died.
The consequence was that, when the hospital clerk
was informed that No. 11 had died, he wrote to the
doctor who placed me in the hospital, informing him
of my death, and the doctor communicated the sad intelligence
to my sister.</p>

<p>"The rest of the story you can fill up, sir, for yourself,
and without my assistance you can imagine how
it was that, while in a state of extreme exhaustion,
and deeming myself dead, I heard my sister, in a
strong agony of sorrow and self-reproach, say to my
nurse, 'Oh, dear friend—dear good nurse—if you
have a sister, don't treat her, as I did Abigail, with
suspicion and wicked passion; for should you, all the
light speeches of your frowardness will return to you,
and lie heavy on your heart when hers shall beat no
more.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>MEDICAL BUILDINGS.</h3>


<p>The medical buildings of London are seldom or
never visited by the sight-seers of the metropolis.
Though the science and art of nursing have recently
been made sources of amusement to the patrons of
circulating libraries, the good sense and delicacy of
the age are against converting the wards of an hospital
into galleries for public amusement. In the last
century the reverse was the case. Fashionable idlers
were not indeed anxious to pry into the mysteries of
Bartholomew's, Guy's, and St. Thomas's hospitals;
for a visit to those magnificent institutions was associated
in their minds with a risk of catching fevers
or the disfiguring small-pox. But Bethlehem, devoted
to the entertainment and cure of the insane,
was a favourite haunt with all classes. "Pepys,"
"The London Spy," "The Tatler," and "The Rake's
Progress," give us vivid pictures of a noisy rout of
Pall Mall beaus and belles, country fly-catchers, and
London scamps, passing up and down the corridors
of the great asylum, mocking its unhappy inmates
with brutal jests, or investigating and gossiping about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
their delusions and extravagances with unfeeling curiosity.
Samuel Johnson enlivened himself with an
occasional stroll amongst the lunatics, just as he periodically
indulged himself with witnessing a hanging,
a judicial flogging, or any other of the pleasant
spectacles with which Hogarth's London abounded.
Boswell and he once strolled through the mansions
of the insane; and on another occasion, when he visited
the same abode with Murphy, Foote, and Wedderburne
(afterwards Lord Loughborough), the philosopher's
"attention was arrested by a man who
was very furious, and who, while beating his straw,
supposed it was William, Duke of Cumberland, whom
he was punishing for his cruelties in Scotland in
1746." Steele, when he took three schoolboys (imagine
the glee of Sir Richard's schoolboy friends out
with him for a frolic) in a hackney coach to show
them the town, paid his respects to "the lions, the
tombs, Bedlam, and the other places, which are entertainments
to raw minds because they strike forcibly
on the fancy." In the same way Pepys "stept
into Bedlam, and saw several poor miserable creatures
in chains, one of whom was <i>mad with making
verses</i>," a form of mental aberration not uncommon
in these days, though we do not deem it necessary
to consign the victims of it to medical guardianship.</p>

<p>The original Bethlehem hospital was established
by Henry VIII., in a religious house that had been
founded in 1246, by Simon Fitz-Mary, Sheriff of
London, as an ecclesiastical body. The house was situated
at Charing-cross, and very soon the king began
to find it (when used for the reception of lunatics)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
disagreeably near his own residence. The asylum was
therefore removed, at a "cost nigh £17,000," to
Bishopgate Without, where it remained till 1814, and
the inmates were removed to the present noble hospital
in St. George's Fields, the first stone of which
was laid April 18th, 1812.</p>

<p>One of the regulations of old Bedlam has long since
been disused. The harmless lunatics were allowed
to roam about the country with a tin badge—the star
of St. Bethlehem—on the right arm. Tenderness
towards those to whom the Almighty has denied reason
is a sentiment not confined to the East. Wherever
these poor creatures went they received alms and
kindly entreatment. The ensign on the right arm
announced to the world their lamentable condition
and their need of help, and the appeal was always
mercifully responded to. Aubrey thus describes their
appearance and condition:—</p>

<p>"Till the breaking out of the Civil Wars Tom o'
Bedlams did travel about the country. They had
been poor distracted men, but had been put into Bedlam,
where recovering some soberness, they were licentiated
to go a-begging, <i>i. e.</i> they had on their left
arm an armilla of tin, about four inches long; they
could not get it off. They wore about their necks
a great horn of an ox in a string of baudry, which,
when they came to an house for alms, they did wind,
and they did put the drink given them into this horn,
whereto they did put the stopple. Since the wars
I do not remember to have seen any one of them."</p>

<p>The custom, however, continued long after the termination
of the Civil War. It is not now the humane
practice to label our fools, so that society may at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
recognise them and entertain them with kindness.
They still go at large in our public ways. Facilities
are even given them for effecting an entrance into
the learned professions. Frequently they are docketed
with titles of respect, and decked with the robes
of office. But however gratifying this plan may be
to their personal vanity it is not unattended with
cruelty. Having about them no external mark of
their sad condition, they are often, through carelessness
and misapprehension—not through hardness of
heart—chastised with undue severity. "Poor Tom,
thy horn is dry," says Edgar, in "Lear." Never
may the horn of mercy be dry to such poor wretches!</p>

<p>It is needless to say that Easter holiday-makers
are no longer permitted in swarms, on the payment
of two-pence each, to race through the St. Bethlehem
galleries, insulting with their ribaldry the most pitiable
of God's afflicted creatures. A useful lesson, however,
is taught to the few strangers who still, as merely
curious observers, obtain admission for a few minutes
within the walls of the asylum—a lesson conveyed,
not by the sufferings of the patients, so much
as by the gentle discipline, the numerous means of
innocent amusement, and the air of quiet contentment,
which are the characteristics of a well-managed
hospital for the insane.</p>

<p>Not less instructive would it be for many who now
know of them only through begging circulars and
charity dinners, to inspect the well-ventilated, cleanly—and
it may be added, <i>cheerful</i>—dwellings of the
impoverished sick of London. The principal hospitals
of the capital, those, namely, to which medical
schools are attached, are eleven in number—St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
George's, the London (at Mile End), University College,
King's, St. Mary's, Westminster, Middlesex,
and Charing-cross, are for the most part dependent
on voluntary contributions for support, the Westminster
Hospital (instituted 1719) being the first
hospital established in this kingdom on the voluntary
system. The three other hospitals of the eleven have
large endowments, Bartholomew's and Guy's being
amongst the wealthiest benevolent foundations of the
country.</p>

<p>Like Bethlehem, St. Thomas's Hospital was originally
a religious house. At the dissolution of the monasteries
it was purchased by the citizens of London,
and, in the year 1552, was opened as an hospital for
the sick. At the commencement of the last century
it was rebuilt by public subscription, three wards
being erected at the cost of Thomas Frederick, and
three by Guy, the founder of Guy's Hospital.</p>

<p>The first place of precedency amongst the London
Hospitals is contended for by St. Bartholomew's and
Guy's. They are both alike important by their
wealth, the number of patients entertained within
their walls, and the celebrity of the surgeons and physicians
with whom their schools have enriched the
medical profession; but the former, in respect of antiquity,
has superior claims to respect. Readers require
no introduction to the founder of Bartholomew's,
for only lately Dr. Doran, in his "Court
Fools," gave a sketch of Rahere—the minstrel and
jester, who spent his prime in the follies and vices
of courts, and his riper years in the sacred offices
of the religious vocation. He began life a buffoon,
and ended it a prior—presiding over the establishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
to the creation of which he devoted the wealth
earned by his abused wit. The monk chronicler says
of him: "When he attained the flower of youth he
began to haunt the households of noblemen and the
palaces of princes; where, under every elbow of them,
he spread their cushions with apeings and flatterings,
delectably anointing their eyes—by this manner
to draw to him their friendships. And yet he was
not content with this, but often haunted the king's
palace; and, among the press of that tumultuous
court, enforced himself with jollity and carnal suavity,
by the which he might draw to him the hearts
of many one." But the gay adventurer found that
the ways of mirth were far from those of true gladness;
and, forsaking quips, and jeers, and wanton
ditties for deeds of mercy, and prayer, and songs of
praise, he long was an ensample unto men of holy
living; and "after the years of his prelacy (twenty-two
years and six months), the 20th day of September
(<small>A. D.</small> 1143), the clay-house of this world forsook,
and the house everlasting entered."</p>

<p>In the church of St. Bartholomew may still be seen
the tomb of Dr. Francis Anthony, who, in spite of
the prosecutions of the College of Physicians, enjoyed
a large practice, and lived in pomp in Bartholomew
Close, where he died in 1623. The merits
of his celebrated nostrum, the <i>aurum potabile</i>, to
which Boyle gave a reluctant and qualified approval,
are alluded to in the inscription commemorating his
services:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There needs no verse to beautify thy praise,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Or keep in memory thy spotless name.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Religion, virtue, and thy skill did raise<br></span>
<span class="i1">A three-fold pillar to thy lasting fame.<br></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though poisonous envy ever sought to blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i1">Or hide the fruits of thy intention,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet shall all they commend that high design<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of purest gold to make a medicine,<br></span>
<span class="i1">That feel thy help by that thy rare invention."<br></span>
</div></div>

<p>Boyle's testimony to the good results of the <i>aurum
potabile</i> is interesting, as his philosophic mind formed
a decided opinion on the efficacy of the preparation
by observing its operation in <i>two</i> cases—persons of
great note. "Though," he says, "I have long been
prejudiced against the <i>aurum potabile</i>, and other
boasted preparations of gold, for most of which I
have no great esteem, yet I saw such extraordinary
and surprising effects from the tincture of gold I
spake of (prepared by two foreign physicians) upon
persons of great note, with whom I was particularly
acquainted, both before they fell sick and after their
dangerous recovery, that I could not but change my
opinion for a very favourable one as to some preparations
of gold."</p>

<p>Attached to his priory of St. Bartholomew's, Rahere
founded an hospital for the relief of poor and sick
persons, out of which has grown the present institution,
over the principal gateway of which stands,
burly and with legs apart—like a big butcher watching
his meat-stall—an effigy of Henry VIII. Another
of the art treasures of the hospital is the staircase
painted by Hogarth.</p>

<p>If an hospital could speak it could tell strange tales—of
misery slowly wrought, ambition foiled, and fair
promise ending in shame. Many a toilworn veteran
has entered the wards of St. Bartholomew's to die
in the very couch by the side of which in his youth he
daily passed—a careless student, joyous with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
spring of life, and little thinking of the storm and
unkind winds rising up behind the smiles of the nearer
future. Scholars of gentle birth, brave soldiers
of proud lineage, patient women whose girlhood, spent
in luxury and refinement, has been followed by
penury, evil entreatment, and destitution, find their
way to our hospitals—to pass from a world of grief
to one where sorrow is not. It is not once in awhile,
but daily, that a physician of any large charitable
institution of London reads a pathetic tale of struggle
and defeat, of honest effort and bitter failure,
of slow descent from grade to grade of misfortune—in
the tranquil dignity, the mild enduring quiet, and
noiseless gratitude of poor sufferers—gentle once in
fortune, gentle still in nature. One hears unpleasant
stories of medical students, their gross dissipations
and coarse manners. Possibly these stories have their
foundation in fact, but at best they are broad and
unjust caricatures. This writer in his youth lived
much amongst the students of our hospitals, as he did
also amongst those of our old universities, and he
found them simple and manly in their lives, zealous
in the pursuit of knowledge, animated by <i>a professional
esprit</i> of the best sort, earnestly believing in
the dignity of their calling, and characterised by a
singular ever-lively compassion for all classes of the
desolate and distressed. And this quality of mercy,
which unquestionably adorns in an eminent degree
the youth of our medical schools, he has always regarded
as a happy consequence of their education,
making them acquainted, in the most practical and
affecting manner, with the sad vicissitudes of human
existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>Guy's hospital was the benevolent work of a London
bookseller, who, by perseverance, economy, and
lucky speculation, amassed a very large fortune.
Thomas Guy began life with a stock of about £200,
as a stationery and bookseller in a little corner house
between Cornhill and Lombard-st., taking out his
freedom of the Stationers' Company in 1668. He was
a thrifty tradesman, but he won his wealth rather
by stock-jobbing than by the sale of books, although
he made important sums by his contract with the University
of Oxford for their privilege of printing bibles.
Maitland informs us, "England being engaged
in an expensive war against France, the poor seamen
on board the royal navy, for many years, instead of
money received tickets for their pay, which those necessitous
but very useful men were obliged to dispose
of at thirty, forty, and sometimes fifty in the hundred
discount. Mr. Guy, discovering the sweets of this
traffick, became an early dealer therein, as well as in
other government securities, by which, and his trade,
he acquired a very great estate." In the South-sea
stock he was not less lucky. He bought largely at the
outset, held on till the bubble reached its full size,
and ere the final burst sold out. It may be questioned
whether Guy's or Rahere's money was earned
the more honourably,—whether to fawn, flatter, and
jest at the table of princes was a meaner course of exertion
than to drive a usurious trade with poor sailors,
and fatten on a stupendous national calamity.
But however basely it may have been gathered together,
Guy's wealth was well expended, in alleviating
the miseries of the same classes from whose sufferings
it had been principally extracted. In his old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
age Guy set about building his hospital, and ere his
death, in 1724, saw it completed. On its erection
and endowment he expended £238,292 16<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> To
his honour it must be stated that, notwithstanding
this expenditure and his munificent contributions to
other charities, he had a considerable residue of
property, which he distributed amongst his poor relations.</p>

<p>Of the collegiate medical buildings of London, the
one that belongs to the humblest department of the
profession is the oldest, and for that reason—apart
from its contents, which are comparatively of little
value—the most interesting. Apothecaries' Hall, in
Water Lane, Blackfriars, was built in 1670. Possibly
the size and imposing aspect of their college stimulated
the drug-vendors to new encroachments on the
prescriptive and enacted rights of the physicians.
The rancour of "The Dispensary" passes over the
merits (graces it has none) of the structure, and designates
it by mentioning its locality—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Nigh where Fleet Ditch descends in sable streams,<br></span>
<span class="i0">To wash his sooty Naiads in the Thames,<br></span>
<span class="i0">There stands a structure on a rising hill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where tyros take their freedom out to kill."</span>
</div>

<p>Amongst the art-treasures of the hall are a portrait
of James I. (who first established the apothecaries
as a company distinct from the grocers), and a bust
of Delaune, the lucky apothecary of that monarch's
queen, who has already been mentioned in these
pages.</p>

<p>The elegant college of the physicians, in Pall Mall
east, was not taken into use till the 25th of June, 1825,
the doctors migrating to it from Warwick Hall, which
is now in the occupation of the butchers of Newgate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
Market. Had the predecessors of the present tenants
been "the surgeons," instead of "the physicians,"
the change of masters would have given occasion for
a joke. As it is, not even the consolation of a jest can
be extracted from the desecration of an abode of
learning that has many claims on our affection.</p>

<p>In "The Dispensary," the proximity of the college
dome to the Old Bailey is playfully pointed
at:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Not far from that most celebrated place,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where angry justice shows her awful face,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Where little villains must submit to fate,<br></span>
<span class="i0">That great ones may enjoy the world in state,<br></span>
<span class="i0">There stands a dome, majestic to the sight,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And sumptuous arches bear its oval height;<br></span>
<span class="i0">A golden globe, placed high with artful skill,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Seems, to the distant sight, a gilded pill:<br></span>
<span class="i0">This pile was, by the pious patron's aim,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Raised for a use as noble as its frame.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did the learn'd society decline<br></span>
<span class="i0">The propagation of that great design;<br></span>
<span class="i0">In all her mazes, Nature's face they view'd,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, as she disappear'd, their search pursued.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapt in the shade of night, the goddess lies,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to the learn'd unveils her dark disguise,<br></span>
<span class="i0">But shuns the gross access of vulgar eyes."</span>
</div>

<p>The Warwick Lane college was erected on the college
at Amen Corner (to which the physicians removed
on quitting their original abode in Knight-Rider
Street), being burnt to the ground in the great
fire of 1666. Charles II. and Sir John Cutler were
ambitious of having their names associated with the
new edifice, the chief fault of which was that, like
all the other restorations following the memorable
conflagration, it was raised near the old site. Charles
became its pious patron, and Sir John Cutler its
munificent benefactor. The physicians duly thanked
them, and honoured them with statues, Cutler's effigy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
having inscribed beneath it, "Omnis Cutleri cedat labor
Amphitheatro."</p>

<p>So far, so good. The fun of the affair remains to
be told. On Sir John's death, his executors, Lord
Radnor and Mr. Boulter, demanded of the college
£7000, which covered in amount a sum the college
had borrowed of their deceased benefactor, and also
the sum he pretended to have given. Eventually the
executors lowered their claim to £2000 (which, it is
reasonable to presume, had been <i>lent</i> by Sir John),
and discontinued their demand for the £5000 given.
Such being the stuff of which Sir John was made, well
might Pope exclaim:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"His Grace's fate sage Cutler could foresee,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And well (he thought) advised him, 'Live like me.'<br></span>
<span class="i0">As well his Grace replied, 'Like you, Sir John?<br></span>
<span class="i0">That I can do when all I have is gone.'"</span>
</div>

<p>In consideration of the £5000 retained of the niggard's
money, the physicians allowed his statue to
remain, but they erased the inscription from beneath
it.</p>

<p>The Royal College of Surgeons in London was
not incorporated till the year 1800—more than half
a century after the final disruption of the surgeons
from the barbers—and the college in Lincoln's Inn
Fields was not erected till 1835. Its noble museum,
based on the Hunterian Collection, which the nation
purchased for £15,000, contains, amongst its treasures,
a few preparations that are valuable for their
historical associations or sheer eccentricity, rather
than for any worth from a strictly scientific point
of view. Amongst them are Martin Van Buchell's
first wife, whose embalmment by William Hunter has
already been mentioned; the intestines of Napoleon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
showing the progress of the disease which was eventually
fatal to him; and the fore-arms (preserved in
spirits) of Thomas Beaufort, third son of John of
Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster.</p>

<p>The writer had recently submitted to his notice,
by Dr. Diamond of Twickenham, a very interesting
and beautifully penned manuscript, relating to these
remains, of which the following is a copy:—</p>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">Bury St Edmunds.</span>
</p>
<p>
"<i>Joseph Pater scripsit, when thirteen years of age.</i><br>
</p>

<p>"On the 20th of February, 1772, some labourers,
employed in breaking up part of the old abbey
church, discovered a leaden coffin, which contained
an embalmed body, as perfect and entire as at the
time of its death; the features and lineaments of the
face were perfect, which were covered with a mask of
embalming materials. The very colour of the eyes
distinguishable; the hairs of the head a brown, intermixed
with some few gray ones; the nails fast
upon the fingers and toes as when living; stature
of the body about six feet tall, and genteelly formed.
The labourers, for the sake of the lead (which
they sold to Mr Faye, a plummer, in this town, for
about 15s), stript the body of its coffin, and threw it
promiscuously amongst the rubbish. From the place
of its interment it was soon found to be the remains
of Thomas Beaufort, third son of John de Gaunt,
Duke of Lancaster, by his third duchess, Lady Catherine
Swineford, relict of Sir Otho de Swineford,
of Lincolnshire. He took the name of Beaufort from
the place of his birth, a castle of the duke's, in
France. He was half-brother to King Henry IV.,
created Duke of Exeter and Knight of the Garter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
in 1410, Lord Chancellor of England; in 1412, High
Admiral of England, and Captain of Calais; he commanded
the Rear-Guard of his nephew King Henry
the Fifth's army at the battle of Agincourt, on the
25th of October, 1415; and in 1422, upon the death of
King Henry the Fifth, was jointly with his brother,
Henry, Cardinal Bishop of Winchester, appointed by
the Parliament to the government, care, and education
of the royal infant, Henry the Sixth. He married
Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Nevil, by whom he
had issue only one son, who died young. He was a
great benefactor to this church, died at East Greenwich,
1427, in the 5th year of King Henry ye Sixth,
and was interred in this Abbey, near his duchess (as
he had by his will directed), at the entrance of the
Chapel of our Lady, close to the wall. On the 24th of
February following, the mangled remains were enclosed
in an oak coffin, and buried about eight feet
deep, close to the north side of the north-east pillar,
which formerly assisted to support the Abbey belfry.
Before its re-interment, the body was mangled
and cut with the most savage barbarity by Thomas
Gery Cullum, a young surgeon in this town, lately
appointed Bath King-at-Arms. The skull sawed in
pieces, where the brain appeared it seemed somewhat
wasted, but perfectly contained in its proper membranes;
the body ript open from the neck to the bottom,
the cheek cut through by a saw entering at the
mouth; his arms chopped off below the elbows and
taken away. One of the arms the said Cullum confesses
to have in spirits. The crucifix, supposed to be
a very valuable one, is missing. It is believed the
body of the duchess was found (within about a foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
of the Duke's) on the 24th of February. If she was
buried in lead she was most likely conveyed away
clandestinely the same night. In this church several
more of the antient royal blood were interred, whose
remains are daily expected to share the same fate.
Every sensible and humane mind reflects with horror
at the shocking and wanton inhumanity with which
the princely remains of the grandson of the victorious
King Edward the Third have been treated—worse
than the body of a common malefactor, and 345 years
after his death. The truth of this paragraph having
been artfully suppressed, or very falsely represented
in the county newspapers, and the conveyance of public
intelligence rendered doubtful, no method could
be taken to convey a true account to the public but by
this mode of offering it."</p>

<p>The young surgeon whose conduct is here so warmly
censured was the younger son of a Suffolk baronet.
On the death of his brother he succeeded to the family
estate and honours, and having no longer any necessity
to exert himself to earn money, relinquished medical
practice. He was born in 1741 and died in 1831.
It is from him that the present baronet, of Hawstead
Place and Hardwicke House, in the county of Suffolk,
is descended.</p>

<p>The fore-arms, now in the custody of the College of
Surgeons, were for a time separated. One of them
was retained by Mr. Cullum, and the other, becoming
the property of some mute inglorious Barnum,
was taken about to all the fairs and wakes of the county,
and exhibited as a raree-show at a penny a peep.
The vagrant member, however, came back after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
while to Mr. Cullum, and he presented both of the mutilated
pertions to their present possessors.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>THE COUNTRY MEDICAL MAN.</h3>


<p>The country doctor, such as we know him—a well-read
and observant man, skilful in his art, with a liberal
love of science, and in every respect a gentleman—is
so recent a creation, that he may almost be
spoken of as a production of the present century.
There still linger in the provinces veteran representatives
of the ignorance which, in the middle of the
last century, was the prevailing characteristic of the
rural apothecary. Even as late as 1816, the law required
no medical education in a practitioner of the
healing art in country districts, beyond an apprenticeship
to an empiric, who frequently had not information
of any kind, beyond the rudest elements
of a druggist's learning, to impart to his pupils.
Men who commenced business under this system are
still to be found in every English county, though in
most cases they endeavour to conceal their lack of
scientific culture under German or Scotch diplomas—bought
for a few pounds.</p>

<p>Scattered over these pages are many anecdotes of
provincial doctors in the sixteenth and seventeenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
centuries, from which a truthful but not complimentary
picture of their order may be obtained. Indeed,
they were for the most part vulgar drunken knaves,
with just learning enough to impose on the foolish
crowds who resorted to them. The most brilliant of
the fraternity in Henry the Eighth's reign was Andrew
Borde, a Winchester practitioner. This gentleman
was author and buffoon, as well as physician.
He travelled about the country from market to fair,
and from fair to market, making comic orations to
the crowds who purchased his nostrums, singing songs,
and enlivening the proceedings when they were becoming
dull with grimaces of inexpressible drollery.
It was said of Sir John Hill,</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"For physic and farces<br></span>
<span class="i1">His equal there scarce is;<br></span>
<span class="i0">His farces are physic,<br></span>
<span class="i1">His physic a farce is."</span>
</div>

<p>Borde's physic doubtless was a farce; but if his
wit resembled physic, it did so, not (like Hill's) by
making men sick, but by rousing their spirits and
bracing their nerves with good hearty laughter. Everywhere
he was known as "Merry Andrew," and his
followers, when they mounted the bank, were proud
to receive the same title.</p>

<p>Mr. H. Fleetwood Sheppard communicated in the
year 1855, some amusing anecdotes to "Notes and
Queries" about the popular Dorsetshire doctor—little
Dr. Grey. Small but warlike, this gentleman, in the
reign of James the First, had a following of well-born
roisterers that enabled him to beard the High
Sheriff at the assizes. He was always in debt, but
as he always carried a brandy-flask and a brace of
loaded pistols in his pocket or about his neck, he neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
experienced the mental harass of impecuniosity
nor feared bailiffs. In the hour of peril he blew a
horn, which he wore suspended to his person, and the
gentlemen of his body-guard rallied round him, vowing
they were his "sons," and would die for him.
Says the MS.—"This Doctor Grey was once arreste
by a pedler, who coming to his house knocked at ye
dore as yey (he being desirous of Hobedyes) useth
to doe, and ye pedler having gartars upon his armes,
and points, &amp;c., asked him whether he did wante any
points or gartars, &amp;c., pedler like. Grey hereat began
to storme, and ye other tooke him by ye arme, and
told him that he had no neede be so angry, and
holdinge him fast, told him y he had ye kinge's proces
for him, and showed him his warrant. 'Hast thou?'
quoth Grey, and stoode stil awhile; but at length,
catchinge ye fellowe by both ends of his collar before,
held him fast, and <i>drawinge out a great rundagger,
brake his head in two or three places</i>."</p>

<p>Again, Dr. Grey "came one day at ye assizes, wheare
ye sheriffe had some sixty men, and he wth his twenty
sonnes, ye trustyest young gentlemen and of ye best
sort and rancke, came and drancke in Dorchester before
ye sheriffe, and bad who dare to touch him; <i>and
so after awhile blew his horn and came away</i>." On
the same terms who would not like to be a Dorsetshire
physician?</p>

<p>In 1569 (<i>vide</i> "Roberts' History of the Southern
Counties") Lyme had no medical practitioner. And
at the beginning of the seventeenth century Sir Symonds
D'Ewes was brought into the world at Coxden
Hall, near Axminster, by a female practitioner, who
deformed him for life by her clumsiness. Yet more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
Mrs. D'Ewes set out with her infant for London, when
the babe, unable to bear the jolting of the carriage,
screamed itself into a violent illness, and had to
be left behind at Dorchester under the care of another
doctress—Mrs. Margaret Waltham. And two generations
later, in 1665, the Rev. Giles Moore, of Essex,
had to send twenty-five miles for an ordinary medical
man, who was paid 12<i>s.</i> per visit, and the same distance
for a physician, whose fee was £1—a second
physician, who came and stayed two days, being paid
£1 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Of the country doctors of the middle and close of
the last century, Dr. Slop is a fair specimen. They
were a rude, vulgar, keen-witted set of men, possessing
much the same sort of intelligence, and disfigured
by the same kind of ignorance, as a country gentleman
expects now to find in his farrier. They had to do
battle with the village nurses at the best on equal
terms, often at a disadvantage; masculine dignity and
superior medical erudition being in many districts
of less account than the force of old usage, and the
sense of decorum that supported the lady practitioners.
Mrs. Shandy had an express provision in her
marriage settlement, securing her from the ignorance
of country doctors. Of course, in respect to learning
and personal acquirements, the rural practitioners,
as a class, varied very much, in accordance with
the intelligence and culture of the district in which
their days were spent, with the class and character
of their patients, and with their own connections and
original social condition. On his Yorkshire living
Sterne came in contact with a rought lot. The Whitworth
Taylors were captains and leaders of the army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
in which Dr. Slop was a private. The original of
the last-mentioned worthy was so ill-read that he
mistook Lithopædii Senonensis Icon for the name
of a distinguished surgical authority, and, under this
erroneous impression, quoted Lithopædus Senonensis
with the extreme of gravity.</p>

<p>This Lithopædus Senonensis story is not without
its companions. A prescription, in which a physician
ordered <i>extract, rad valer.</i>, and immediately
under it, as an ingredient in the same mixture, a
certain quantity of <i>tinctura ejusdem</i>, sorely perplexed
the poor apothecary to who it was sent to be
dispensed. <i>Tinctura ejusdem!</i> What could it be!
<i>Ejusdem!</i> In the whole pharmacopoeia such a drug
was not named. Nothing like it was to be found on
any label in his shop. At his wits' end, the poor fellow
went out to a professional neighbour, and asked,
in an off-hand way, "How are you off for <i>Tinctura
Ejusdem</i>? I am out of it. So can you let me have
a little of yours." The neighbour, who was a sufficiently
good classical scholar to have <i>idem</i>, <i>eadem</i>,
<i>idem</i> at his tongue's end, lamented that he too was
"out of the article." and sympathizingly advised his
<i>confrère</i>, without loss of time, to apply for some at
Apothecaries' Hall. What a delightful blunder to
make to a <i>friend</i>, of all the people in the world! The
apothecary must have been a dull as well as an unlettered
fellow, or he would have known the first great
rule of his art—"When in doubt—<i>Use water!</i>" A
more awkward mistake still was that made by the
young dispenser, who, for the first time in his life,
saw at the end of a prescription the words <i>pro re
natâ</i>. What could they mean? <i>pro re natâ!</i> What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
could <i>pro re natâ</i> have to do with a mixture sent to
a lady who had just presented her husband with an
heir. With the aid of a Latin Dictionary, the novice
rendered <i>pro re natâ</i> "for the thing born." Of
course. Clearly the mixture was for the baby. And
in a trice the compound to be taken by an adult, as
circumstances should indicate a necessity for a dose,
was sent off for the "little stranger."</p>

<p>May not mention here be made of thee, ancient
friend of childhood, Roland Trevor? The whole country
round, for a circle of which the diameter measured
thirty fair miles, thou wert one of the most popular
doctors of East Anglia. Who rode better horses?
Who was the bolder in the hunt, or more joyous
over the bottle? Cheery of voice, with hearty laughter
rolling from purple lips, what company thou wert
to festive squires! The grave some score years since
closed over thee, when ninety-six years had passed
over thy head—covering it with silver tresses, and
robbing the eye of its pristine fire, and the lip of its
mirthful curl. The shop of a country apothecary
had been thy only <i>Alma Mater</i>; so, surely, it was no
fault of thine if thy learning was scanty. Still, in
the pleasant vales of Loes and Wilford is told the
story of how, on being asked if thou wert a believer in
<i>phrenology</i>, thou didst answer with becoming gravity,
"I never keep it, and I never use it. But I think it
highly probable that, given frequently and in liberal
doses, it would be very useful in certain cases of irregular
gout."</p>

<p>Another memory arises of a country doctor of the
old school. A huge, burly, surly, churlish old fellow
was Dr. Standish. He died in extremely advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
age, having lived twenty-five years in the present
century. A ferocious radical, he was an object of considerable
public interest during the period of political
excitement consequent on the French Revolution.
Tom Paine, the Thetford breeches-maker of whom the
world has heard a little, was his familiar friend
and correspondent. It was rumoured throughout the
land that "government" had marked the doctor out
for destruction.</p>

<p>"Thar sai," the humbler Suffolk farmers used to
gossip amongst themselves, "thar sai a picter-taikin
chap hav guv his poortright to the King. And Billy
Pitt ha'sin it. And oold King Georgie ha' swaren as
how that sooner nor later he'll hav his hid" (<i>i. e.</i>
head).</p>

<p>The "upper ten" of Holmnook, and the upper ten-times-ten
of the distance round about Holmnook,
held themselves aloof from such a dangerous character.
But the common folk believed in and admired
him. There was something of romance about a man
whom George III. and Billy Pitt were banded together
to destroy.</p>

<p>Standish was a man of few words. "Down with
the bishops!" "Up with the people!" were his stock
sentiments. He never approached nearer poetry than
when (yellow being then the colour of the extreme
liberal party in his district) he swore "there worn't
a flower in the who' o' crashun warth lookin' at but
a sunflower, for that was yallow, and a big un."</p>

<p>The man had no friends in Holmnook or the neighbourhood;
but every evening for fifty years he sate,
in the parlour of the chief inn, drinking brandy-and-water,
and smoking a "churchwarden." His wife—(his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
wooing must have been of a queer sort)—a quiet,
inoffensive little body, sometimes forgot she was but
a woman, and presumed to have an opinion of her
own. On such occasions Standish thrashed her
soundly with a dog-whip. In consequence of one of
these castigations she ran away from her tyrant.
Instead of pursuing her, Dr. Standish merely inserted
the following advertisement in the county paper:—</p>

<p>"<i>Dr Standish to all whom it may concern.</i>—Dr
Standish's wife having run away, he wants a housekeeper.
Dr Standish doesn't want good looks in a
woman: but she must know how to hold her tongue
and cook a plain joint. He gives ten pounds. Mrs
Standish needn't apply—she's too much of a lady."</p>

<p>But poor Mrs. Standish did apply, and, what is
more, obtained the situation. She and her lord never
again had any quarrel that obtained publicity; and
so the affair ended more happily than in all probability
it would have done had Sir Creswell Creswell's
court been then in existence. Standish's practice lay
principally amongst the mechanics and little farmers
of the neighborhood. Much of his time was therefore
spent in riding his two huge lumbering horses
about the country. In his old age he indulged himself
in a gig (which, out of respect to radical politics,
he painted with a flaring yellow paint); but, at the
commencement of the present century, the by-roads
of Suffolk—now so good that a London brougham
drawn by one horse can with ease whisk over the worst
of them at the rate of ten miles an hour—were so
bad that a doctor could not make an ordinary round
on them in a wheeled carriage. Even in the saddle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
he ran frequent risk of being mired, unless his
horse had an abundance of bone and pluck.</p>

<p>Standish's mode of riding was characteristic of the
man. Straight on he went, at a lumbering six miles
an hour trot—dash, dosh, dush!—through the muddy
roads, sitting loosely in his seat, heavy and shapeless
as a sack of potatoes, looking down at his brown
corduroy breeches and his mahogany top-boots (the
toes of which pointed in directly opposite directions),
wearing a perpetual scowl on his brows, and
never either rising in his stirrups or fixing himself
to the saddle with his knees. Not a word would
he speak to a living creature in the way of civil
greeting.</p>

<p>"Doctor, good morning to you," an acquaintance
would cry out; "'tis a nice day!"</p>

<p>"Ugh!" Standish would half grunt, half roar,
trotting straight on—dish, dosh, dush!</p>

<p>"Stop, doctor, I am out of sorts, and want some
physic," would be the second form of address.</p>

<p>"Then why the —— —— didn't you say so, instead
of jawing about the weather?" the urbane physician
would say, checking his horse.</p>

<p>Standish never turned out an inch for any wayfarer.
Sullen and overbearing, he rode straight on
upon one side of the road; and, however narrow the
way might be, he never swerved a barley-corn from
his line for horse or rider, cart or carriage. Our
dear friend Charley Halifax gave him a smart lesson
in good manners on this point. Charley had brought
a well-bred hackney, and a large fund of animal spirits,
down from Cambridge to a title for orders in
mid-Suffolk. He had met Standish in the cottages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
of some of his flock, and afterwards meeting elsewhere,
had greeted him, and had no greeting in return.
It was not long ere Charley learnt all about
the clownish apothecary, and speedily did he devise
a scheme for humbling him. The next time he saw
Standish in the distance, trotting on towards him,
Charley put his heels to his horse, and charged the
man of drugs at full gallop. Standish came lumbering
on, disdaining to look before him and ascertain
who was clattering along at such a pace. On arriving
within six feet of Standish's horse, Halifax fell
back on his curb-rein, and pulled up sharp. Astonished,
but more sensible than his master, Standish's
horse (as Charley knew would be the case) suddenly
came to a dead stop, on which Standish rolled over
its head into the muddy highway. As he rolled over,
he threw out a volley of oaths. "Ah, doctor," cried
Charley, good-humoredly, "I said I would make you
speak to me." Standish was six feet high, and a powerful
man. For a few moments, on recovering his
legs, he looked as if he contemplated an assault on the
young parson. But he thought better of it; and,
climbing into his seat once more, trotted on, without
another word—dish, dosh, dush! The incident didn't
tend to soften his feelings toward the Established
Church.</p>

<p>The country doctor of the last century always went
his rounds on horseback booted and spurred. The
state of the roads rendered any other mode of travelling
impracticable to men who had not only to use
the highways and coach-roads, but to make their way
up bridle-paths, and drifts, and lanes, to secluded
farmsteads and outlying villages. Even as late as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
the last generation, in Suffolk, where now people
drive to and fro at the rate of twelve miles an hour,
a doctor (whom the writer of these pages has reason
to think of with affection) was more than once mired,
on a slightly-built blood horse, so effectually, that
he had to dismount ere the animal could be extricated;
and this happened in roads that at the present
time are, in all seasons, firm as a garden walk.</p>

<p>Describing the appearance of a country doctor of
this period, a writer observes—"When first I saw
him, it was on Frampton Green. I was somewhat
his junior in years, and had heard so much of him
that I had no small curiosity to see him. He was
dressed in a blue coat and yellow buttons, buckskins,
well-polished jockey-boots, with handsome silver
spurs, and he carried a smart whip with a silver
handle. His hair, after the fashion, was done up in
a club, and he wore a broad-brimmed hat." Such was
the appearance of Jenner, as he galloped across the
vale of Gloucester, visiting his patients. There is
little to remind us of such a personage as this in the
statue in Trafalgar Square, which is the slowly-offered
tribute of our gratitude to Edward Jenner for his imperishable
services to mankind. The opposition that
Jenner met with in his labours to free our species
from a hideous malady that, destroying life and obliterating
beauty, spared neither the cottage nor the
palace, is a subject on which it is painful to reflect.
The learned of his own profession and the vulgar of
all ranks combined to persecute and insult him; and
when the merit of his inestimable discovery was acknowledged
by all intelligent persons, he received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
from his country a remuneration that was little better
than total neglect.</p>

<p>While acting as an apprentice to a country surgeon
he first conceived the possibility of checking
the ravages of small-pox. A young servant woman,
who accidentally said that she was guarded from that
disease by having "had cow-pox," first apprized him
that amongst the servants of a rural population a belief
existed that the virus from the diseased cow, on
being absorbed by the human system, was a preventive
against small-pox. From that time, till the
ultimate success of his inquiries, he never lost sight
of the subject.</p>

<p>The ridicule and misrepresentation to which he
was subjected are at this date more pleasant for us
to laugh at than, at the time, they were for him to
bear. The ignorant populace of London was instructed
that people, on being vaccinated, ran great risks
of being converted into members of the bovine family.
The appearance of hair covering the whole body,
of horns and a tail, followed in many cases the operation.
The condition of an unhappy child was pathetically
described, who, brutified by vaccine ichor,
persisted in running on all-fours and roaring like a
bull. Dr. Woodville and Dr. Moseley opposed Jenner,
the latter with a violence that little became a scientific
inquirer. Numerous were the squibs and caricatures
the controversy called forth. Jenner was
represented as riding on a cow—an animal certainly
not adapted to show the doctor ("booted and
spurred" as we have just seen him) off to the best
advantage. Of Moseley the comic muse sung:</p>

<div class="poem"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, Moseley! thy book, nightly phantasies rousing,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Full oft makes me quake for my heart's dearest treasure;<br></span>
<span class="i0">For fancy, in dreams, oft presents them all browsing<br></span>
<span class="i1">On commons, just like little Nebuchadnezzar.<br></span>
<span class="i0"><i>There</i>, nibbling at thistle, stand Jem, Joe, and Mary,<br></span>
<span class="i1">On their foreheads, O horrible! crumpled horns bud:<br></span>
<span class="i0">There Tom with his tail, and poor William all hairy,<br></span>
<span class="i1">Reclined in a corner, are chewing the cud."</span>
</div>

<p>If London was unjust to him, the wiseacres of
Gloucestershire thought that burning was his fit punishment.
One dear old lady, whenever she saw him
leaving his house, used to run out and attack him
with indescribable vivacity. "So your book," cried
this charming matron, in genuine Gloucestershire dialect,
"is out at last. Well! I can tell you that there
bean't a copy sold in our town, nor shan't neither,
if I can help it." On hearing, subsequent to the
publication of the book (a great offence to the old
lady!), some rumours of vaccination failures, the
same goodie bustled up to the doctor and cried, with
galling irony, "Shan't us have a general inoculation
now?"</p>

<p>But Jenner was compensated for this worthy
woman's opposition in the enthusiastic support of
Rowland Hill, who not only advocated vaccination in
his ordinary conversation, but from the pulpit used to
say, after his sermon to his congregation, wherever he
preached, "I am ready to vaccinate to-morrow morning
as many children as you choose; and if you wish
them to escape that horrid disease, the small-pox, you
will bring them." A Vaccine Board was also established
at the Surrey Chapel—<i>i. e.</i> the Octagon Chapel,
in Blackfriars Road.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said Rowland Hill once to a nobleman,
"allow me to present to your Lordship my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
friend, Dr. Jenner, who has been the means of saving
more lives than any other man."</p>

<p>"Ah!" observed Jenner, "would that I, like you,
could say—souls."</p>

<p>There was no cant in this. Jenner was a simple,
unaffected, and devout man. His last words were,
"I do not marvel that men are grateful to me, but
I am surprised that they do not feel gratitude to God
for making me a medium of good."</p>

<p>Of Jenner's more sprightly humour, the following
epigrams from his pen (communicated to the writer
of these pages by Dr. E. D. Moore of Salop), are good
specimens.</p>

been published.</p>

<p>Babbage, in his "Decline of Science in England,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
has remarked that "some of the most valuable names
which adorn the history of English science have been
connected with this (the medical) profession." Of
those names many have belonged to country doctors;
amongst which Jenner has a conspicuous place.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/40161/40161-h/40161-h.htm#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Jenner was a bright representative of that class
of medical practitioners—sagacious, well-instructed,
courageous, and self-dependent in intellect—who, at
the close of the last century, began to spring up in all
parts of the country, and have rapidly increased in
number; so that now the prejudiced, vulgar, pedantic
doctors of Sterne's and Smollett's pages are extinct—no
more to be found on the face of the earth than are
the drunken squires who patronized and insulted
them.</p>

<p>Of such a sort was Samuel Parr, the father of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
famous classic scholar and Whig politician of the
same name. The elder Parr was a general practitioner
at Harrow, "a man" (as his son described him)
"of a very robust and vigorous intellect." Educated
in his early years at Harrow School, Samuel Parr
(the son) was taken from that splendid seminary
at the age of fourteen years and apprenticed to his
father. For three or four years he applied himself
to the mastery of the elements of surgical and medical
knowledge—dispensing medicines, assisting at operations,
and performing all the duties which a country
doctor's pupil was expected to perform. But he
had not nerve enough for the surgical department
of the profession. "For a physician," he used to say,
"I might have done well, but for a surgeon never."
His father consequently sent him to Cambridge, and
allowed him to turn his intellects to those pursuits
in which Nature had best fitted him to excel. Dr.
Parr's reminiscences of this period of medical instruction
were nearly all pleasant—and some of them
were exquisitely droll. At that early age his critical
taste and faculty caused him to subject the prescriptions
that came under his notice to a more exact scrutiny
than the dog-Latin of physicians usually undergoes.</p>

<p>"Father," cried the boy, glancing his eye over a
prescription, "here's another mistake in the grammar!"</p>

<p>"Sam," answered the irritable sire, "d—— the
prescription, make up the medicine."</p>

<p>Laudanum was a preparation of opium just then
coming into use. Mr. Parr used it at first sparingly
and cautiously. On one occasion he administered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
small quantity to a patient, and the next day, pleased
with the effects of the dose, expressed his intention
(but hesitatingly) to repeat it.</p>

<p>"You may do that safely, sir," said the son.</p>

<p>"Don't be rash, boy. Beginners are always too
bold. How should you know what is safe?" asked
the father.</p>

<p>"Because, sir," was the answer, "when I made
up the prescription yesterday, I doubled the dose."</p>

<p>"Doubled the dose! How dared you do that?" exclaimed
the angry senior.</p>

<p>"Because, sir," answered little Sam, coolly, "<i>I saw
you hesitate.</i>"</p>

<p>The father who would not feel pride in such a son
would not deserve to have him.</p>

<p>Though Parr made choice of another profession he
always retained a deep respect for his father's calling
and the practitioners of it; medical men forming a
numerous and important portion of his acquaintance.
In his years of ripest judgment he often declared that
"he considered the medical professors as the most
learned, enlightened, moral, and liberal class of the
community."</p>

<p>How many pleasant reminiscences this writer has
of country surgeons—a class of men interesting to an
observer of manners, as they comprise more distinct
types of character than any other professional body.
Hail to thee, Dr. Agricola! more yeoman than <i>savant</i>,
bluff, hearty, and benevolent, hastening away from
fanciful patients to thy farm, about which it is thy
pleasure, early and late, to trudge, vigilant and
canny, clad in velveteen jacket and leathern gaiters,
armed with spud-stick or double-barrel gun, and looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
as unlike Andrew Borde or Dr. Slop as it is possible
to conceive mortal! What an eccentric, pious,
tyrannical, most humane giant thou art! When thou
wast mayor of thy borough, what lawless law didst
thou maintain! With thine own arm and oaken stick
didst thou fustigate the drunken poacher who beat his
wife; and the little children, who made a noise in the
market-square on a Sunday, thou didst incarcerate
(for the sake of public morality) in "the goose-house"
for two hours; but (for the sake of mercy)
thou didst cause to be served out to each prisoner one
large gingerbread bun—to soften the hardships of
captivity. When the ague raged, and provisions were
scarce in what the poor still refer to as "the bad
year," what prescriptions didst thou, as parish doctor,
shower down on the fever-ridden?—Mutton and
gin, beef and wine—such were thy orders! The parsons
said bravo! and clapt thee on the back; but the
guardians of the poor and the relieving officers were
up in arms, and summoned thee before a solemn tribunal
at the union-house—"the board!" in fact.
What an indignant oath and scream of ridicule didst
thou give, when an attorney (Sir Oracle of "the
board") endeavoured to instil into thy mind the first
principles of supply and demand, and that grandest
law of political economy—to wit, if there are too
many poor people in a neighbourhood, they must be
starved out of it into one where they will not be in
the way; and if there are too many poor people in the
entire world, they must be starved out of that also
into another, where there'll be more room for them!
And what was thy answer to the chairman's remark,
"Doctor, if mutton and gin are the only medicines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
that will cure the sick poor, you must supply them
yourself, in accordance with your contract"? What
was thy answer? Why, a shower of butchers' and
vintners' bills, pulled from the pockets of thy ancient
gray coat—bills all receipted, and showing that, before
asking the ratepayers for a doit, thou hadst expended
every penny of thy salary of £150 on mutton
and gin, beef and wine—for the sick poor! What a
noble answer to a petty taunt! The chairman
blushed. The attorney hurried away, saying he had
to be present at an auction. The great majority of
"the board" came to a resolution, engaging to support
you in your schemes for helping the poor through
the bad year. But the play was not yet at an end.
Some rumours of what had occurred at the board
reaching the ears of a few poor peasants, they made
bold to thank thee for thy exertions in their behalf.
How didst thou receive them?—With a violent harrangue
against their incorrigible laziness and dishonesty—an
assurance that half their sufferings sprung
from their own vices—and a vehement declaration
that, far from speaking a good word for them to the
guardians, thou didst counsel the sternest and cruellest
of measures.</p>

<p>A man of another mould and temper was the writer's
dear friend, Felix. Gentle and ardent, tranquil
as a summer evening, and unyielding as a rock,
modest but brave, unobtrusive but fearless, he had a
mind that poets only could rightly read. Delicate in
frame, as he was refined in intellect, he could not
endure rude exertion or vulgar pleasure. Active in
mind, he still possessed a vein of indolence, thoroughly
appreciating the pleasure of dreaming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
whole day long on a sunny chair in a garden, surrounded
with bright flowers and breathing a perfumed
air. In the hot season the country people used
to watch their doctor traversing the country in his
capacious phaeton. Alone, without a servant by his
side, he held the reins in his hands, but in his reveries
altogether forgot to use them. Sometimes he would
fall asleep, and travel for miles in a state of unconsciousness,
his great phlegmatic horse pounding the
dust at the rate of five miles an hour. The somni-driverous
doctor never came to harm. His steed
knew how to keep on the left-hand side of the road,
under ordinary circumstances passing all vehicles
securely, but never thinking of overtaking any; and
the country people, amongst whom the doctor spent
his days, made his preservation from bodily harm an
object of their especial care. Often did a rustic wayfarer
extricate the doctor's equipage from a perilous
position, and then send it onwards without disturbing
the gentleman by waking him. The same placid,
equable man was Felix in society, that he was on these
professional excursions—nothing alarming or exciting
him. It was in his study that the livelier elements
of his nature came into play. Those who, for the first
time, conversed with him in private on his microscopic
and chemical pursuits, his researches in history,
or his labours in speculative or natural philosophy,
caught fire from his fire and were inspired with
his enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Felix belonged to a class daily becoming more numerous;
Miles was of a species that has already become
rare—the army surgeon. The necessities of the long
war caused the enrolment of numbers of young men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
in the ranks of the medical profession, whose learning
was not their highest recommendation to respect. An
old navy surgeon, of no small wit, and an infinite
capacity for the consumption of strong liquors—wine,
brandy, whisky, usquebaugh (anything, so long as it
was strong)—gave a graphic description to this
writer of his examination on things pertaining to surgery
by the Navy Board.</p>

<p>"Well," said the narrator, putting down his empty
glass and filling it again with Madeira—"I was shown
into the examination-room. Large table, and half-a-dozen
old gentlemen at it. 'Big-wigs, no doubt,'
thought I; 'and sure as my name is Symonds, they'll
pluck me like a pigeon.'</p>

<p>"'Well, sir, what do you know about the science of
your profession?' asked the stout man in the chair.</p>

<p>"'More than he does of the practice, I'll be bound,'
tittered a little wasp of a dandy—a West End ladies'
doctor.</p>

<p>"I trembled in my shoes.</p>

<p>"'Well, sir,' continued the stout man, 'what would
you do if a man was brought to you during action
with his arms and legs shot off? Now, sir, don't keep
the Board waiting! What would you do? Make
haste!'</p>

<p>"'By Jove, sir!' I answered—a thought just striking
me—'I should pitch him overboard, and go on to
some one else I could be of more service to.'</p>

<p>"By — —! every one present burst out laughing;
and they passed me directly, sir—passed me directly!"</p>

<p>The examiners doubtless felt that a young man
who could manifest such presence of mind on such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
occasion, and so well reply to a terrorizing question,
might be trusted to act wisely on other emergencies.</p>

<p>Many stories of a similar kind are very old
acquaintances of most of our readers.</p>

<p>"What"—an examiner of the same Board is reported
to have said to a candidate—"would you have
recourse to if, after having ineffectually tried all the
ordinary diaphoretics, you wanted to throw your
patient, in as short a time as possible, into a profuse
perspiration?"</p>

<p>"I should send him here, sir, to be examined," was
the reply.</p>

<p>Not less happy was the audacity of the medical
student to Abernethy.</p>

<p>"What would you do," bluntly inquired the surgeon,
"if a man was brought to you with a broken
leg?"</p>

<p>"Set it, sir," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Good—very good—you're a very pleasant, witty
young man; and doubtless you can tell me what muscles
of my body I should set in motion if I kicked you,
as you deserve to be kicked, for your impertinence."</p>

<p>"You would set in motion," responded the youth,
with perfect coolness, "the flexors and extensors of
my right arm; for I should immediately knock you
down."</p>

<p>If the gentlemen so sent forth to kill and cure were
not overstocked with professional learning, they soon
acquired a knowledge of their art in that best of all
schools—experience. At the conclusion of the great
war they were turned loose upon the country, and
from their body came many of the best and most successful
practitioners of every county of the kingdom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
The race is fast dying out. A Waterloo banquet of
medical officers, serving in our army at that memorable
battle, would at the present time gather together
only a small number of veterans. This writer can remember
when they were plentiful; and, in company
with two or three of the best of their class, he spent
many of the happiest days of his boyhood. An aroma
of old camp life hung about them. They rode better
horses, and more boldly, than the other doctors round
about. However respectable they might have become
with increased years and prosperity, they retained
the military knack of making themselves especially
comfortable under any untoward combination of external
circumstances. To gallop over a bleak heath,
through the cold fog of a moonless December night; to
sit for hours in a stifling garret by a pauper's pallet;
to go for ten days without sleeping on a bed, without
undressing, and with the wear of sixteen hours out of
every twenty-four spent on horseback—were only
features of "duty," and therefore to be borne manfully,
and with generous endurance, at the time—and,
in the retrospect, to be talked of with positive contentment
and hilarity. They loved the bottle, too—as
it ought to be loved: on fit occasions drinking any
given quantity, and, in return, giving any quantity
to drink; treating claret and the thinner wines with
a levity at times savouring of disdain; but having a
deep and unvarying affection for good sound port,
and, at the later hours, very hot and very strong
whisky and water, <i>with</i> a slice of lemon in each tumbler.
How they would talk during their potations!
What stories and songs! George the Fourth (even
according to his own showing) had scarce more to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
in bringing about the victory at Waterloo than they.
Lord Anglesey's leg must have been amputated
thrice; for this writer knew three surgeons who each—separately
and by himself—performed the operation.
But this sort of boasting was never indulged in before
the —th tumbler.</p>

<p>May a word not be here said on the toping country
doctor? Shame on these times! ten years hence one
will not be able to find a bibulous apothecary, though
search be made throughout the land from Dan to
Beersheba! Sailors, amongst the many superstitions
to which they cling with tenacity, retain a decided
preference for an inebrious to a sober surgeon. Not
many years since, in a fishing village on the eastern
coast, there flourished a doctor in great repute
amongst the poor; and his influence over his humble
patients literally depended on the fact that he was
sure, once in the four-and-twenty hours, to be handsomely
intoxicated. Charles Dickens has told the
public how, when he bought the raven immortalised in
"Barnaby Rudge," the vendor of that sagacious bird,
after enumerating his various accomplishments and
excellences, concluded, "But, sir, if you want him to
come out very strong, you must show him a drunk
man." The simple villagers of Flintbeach had a firm
faith in the strengthening effects of looking at a tipsy
doctor. They always postponed their visits to Dr.
Mutchkin till evening, because then they had the benefit
of the learned man in his highest intellectual condition.
"Dorn't goo to he i' the mornin', er can't
doctor noways to speak on tills er's had a glass," was
the advice invariably given to a stranger not aware
of the doctor's little peculiarities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>Mutchkin was unquestionably a shrewd fellow,
although he did his best to darken the light with
which nature had endowned him. One day, accompanied
by his apprentice, he visited a small tenant
farmer who had been thrown on his bed with a smart
attack of bilious fever. After looking at his patient's
tongue and feeling his pulse, he said somewhat
sharply:—</p>

<p>"Ah! 'tis no use doing what's right for you, if you
will be so imprudent."</p>

<p>"Goodness, doctor, what do you mean?" responded
the sick man; "I have done nothing imprudent."</p>

<p>"What!—nothing imprudent? Why, bless me,
man, you have had green peas for dinner."</p>

<p>"So I have, sir. But how did you find that out?"</p>

<p>"In your pulse—in your pulse. It was very foolish.
Mind, you mayn't commit such an indiscretion
again. It might cost you your life."</p>

<p>The patient, of course, was impressed with Mutchkin's
acuteness, and so was the apprentice. When the
lad and his master had retired, the former asked:—</p>

<p>"How did you know he had taken peas for dinner,
sir? Of course it wasn't his pulse that told you."</p>

<p>"Why, boy," the instructor replied, "I saw the
pea-shells that had been thrown into the yard, and I
drew my inference."</p>

<p>The hint was not thrown away on the youngster.
A few days afterwards, being sent to call on the same
case, he approached the sick man, and, looking very
observant, felt the pulse.</p>

<p>"Ah!—um—by Jove!" exclaimed the lad, mimicking
his master's manner, "this is very imprudent. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
may cost you your life. Why, man, you've eaten
a horse for your dinner."</p>

<p>The fever patient was so infuriated with what he
naturally regarded as impertinence, that he sent a
pathetic statement of the insult offered him to Mutchkin.
On questioning his pupil as to what he meant by
accusing a man, reduced with sickness, of having consumed
so large and tough an animal, the doctor was
answered—</p>

<p>"Why, sir, as I passed through from the yard I
saw the saddle hanging up in the kitchen."</p>

<p>This story is a very ancient one. It may possibly
be found in one of the numerous editions of Joe Miller's
facetiæ. The writer has, however, never met
with it in print, and the first time he heard it, Dr.
Mutchkin, of Flintbeach, was made to figure in it in
the matter above described.</p>

<p>The shrewdness of Mutchkin's apprentice puts us
in mind of the sagacity of the hydropathic doctor,
mentioned in the "Life of Mr Assheton Smith." A
gentleman devoted to fox-hunting and deep potations
was induced, by the master of the Tedworth Hunt, to
have recourse to the water cure, and see if it would
not relieve him of chronic gout, and restore something
of the freshness of youth. The invalid acted on the
advice, and in obedience to the directions of a hydropathic
physician, proceeded to swathe his body, upon
going to his nightly rest, with wet bandages. The air
was chill, and the water looked—very—cold. The
patient shivered as his valet puddled the bandages
about in the cold element. He paused, as a schoolboy
does, before taking his first "header" for the year on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
a keen May morning; and during the pause much of
his noble resolve oozed away.</p>

<p>"John," at last he said to his valet, "put into that
d—— water half a dozen bottles of port wine, to
warm it."</p>

<p>John having carried out the direction, the bandages,
saturated with port wine and water, were placed
round the corpulent trunk of the invalid. The next
morning the doctor, on paying his visit and inspecting
the linen swathes, instead of expressing astonishment
at their discoloration with the juice of the grape,
observed, with the utmost gravity:—</p>

<p>"Ah, the system is acting beautifully. See, the
port wine is already beginning to leave you!"</p>

<p>A different man from Dr. Mutchkin was jovial Ambrose
Harvey. Twenty years ago no doctor throughout
his county was more successful—no man more beloved.
By natural strength of character he gained
leave from society to follow his own humours without
let, hindrance, or censure. Ladies did not think the
less highly of his professional skill because he visited
them in pink, and left their bedsides to ride across the
country with Lord Cheveley's hounds. Six feet high,
handsome, hearty, well-bred, Ambrose had a welcome
wherever there was joy or sickness. To his little wife
he was devotedly attached and very considerate; and
she in return was very fond, and—what with woman
is the same thing—very jealous of him. He was
liked, she well knew, by the country ladies, many of
whom were so far her superiors in rank and beauty
and accomplishments, that it was only natural in the
good little soul to entertain now and then a suspicious
curiosity about the movements of her husband. Was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
it nothing but the delicate health of Lady Ellin that
took him so frequently to Hove Hall? How it came
about, from what charitable whisperings on the part
of kind friends, from what workings of original sin
in her own gentle breast, it would be hard to say; but
'tis a fact that, when Hove Hall was mentioned, a
quick pain seized the little wife's heart and colour
left her cheek, to return again quickly, and in increased
quantity. The time came when she discovered
the groundlessness of her fears, and was deeply
thankful that she had never, in any unguarded
moment, by clouded brow, or foolish tears, or sharp
reply, revealed the folly of her heart. Just at the
time that Mrs. Ambrose was in the midst of this trial
of her affection, Ambrose obtained her permission to
drive over to a town twelve miles distant, to attend
the hunt dinner. The night of that dinner was a
memorable one with the doctor's wife. Ambrose had
promised to be home at eleven o'clock. But twelve
had struck, and here he had not returned. One o'clock—two
o'clock! No husband! The servants had been
sent to bed four hours ago; and Mrs. Ambrose sate
alone in her old wainscotted parlour, with a lamp by
her side, sad, and pale, and feverish—as wakeful as
the house-dog out of doors, that roamed round the
house, barking out his dissatisfaction at the prolonged
absence of his master.</p>

<p>At length, at half-past two, a sound of wheels was
at the door, and in another minute Ambrose entered
the hall, and greeted his little wife. Ah, Mrs. Ellis,
this writer will not pain you by entering into details
in this part of his story. In defence of Ambrose, let
it be said that it was the only time in all his married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
life that he paid too enthusiastic homage to the god
of wine. Something he mumbled about being tired,
and having a headache, and then he walked, not over-steadily,
upstairs. Poor Mrs. Ambrose! It was not
any good asking <i>him</i>, what had kept him out so late.
Incensed, frightened, and jealous, the poor little lady
could not rest. She must have one doubt resolved.
Where had her husband been all this time? Had he
been round by Hove Hall? Had she reflected, she
would have seen his Bacchic drowsiness was the best
possible evidence that he had not come from a lady's
drawing-room. But jealousy is love's blindness. A
thought seized the little woman's head; she heard the
step of Ambrose's man in the kitchen, about to retire
to rest. Ah, he could tell her. A word from him
would put all things right. Quick as thought, without
considering her own or her husband's dignity, the
angry little wife hastened down-stairs, and entered
the kitchen where John was paying his respects to
some supper and mild ale that had been left out for
him. As evil fortune would have it, the step she had
taken to mend matters made them worse.</p>

<p>"Oh, John," said the lady, telling a harmless fib,
"I have just come to see if cook left you out a good
supper."</p>

<p>John—most civil and trustworthy of grooms—rose,
and posing himself on his heels, made a respectful
obeisance to his mistress, not a little surprised at her
anxiety for his comfort. But, alas! the potations at
the hunt-dinner had not been confined to the gentlemen
of the hunt. John had, in strong ale, taken as
deep draughts of gladness as Ambrose had in wine.
At a glance his mistress saw the state of the case, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
in her fright, losing all caution, put her question
point-blank, and with imperious displeasure—"John,
where have you and your master been?—tell me instantly."</p>

<p>An admirable servant—honest and well-intentioned
at all times—just then confused and loquacious—John
remembered him how often his master had impressed
upon him that it was his duty not to gossip
about the places he stopped at in his rounds, as professional
secrecy was a virtue scarcely less necessary
in a doctor's man-servant than in a doctor. Acting
on a muddle-headed reminiscence of his instructions,
John reeled towards his mistress, endeavouring to
pacify her with a profusion of duteous bobbings of
the head, and in a tone of piteous sympathy, and with
much incoherence, made this memorable answer to her
question: "I'm very sorry, mum, and I do hope,
mum, you won't be angry. I allus wish to do you my
best duty—that I do, mum—and you're a most good,
affable missus, and I, and cook, and all on us are very
grateful to you."</p>

<p>"Never mind that. Where have you and your master
been? That's my question."</p>

<p>"Indeed, mum—I darnatellye, it would bes goodasmeplace
wi' master. I dare not say where we ha'
been. For master rekwested me patikler not to dewulge."</p>

<p>But thou hadst not wronged thy wife. It was not
thine to hurt any living thing, dear friend. All who
knew thee will bear witness that to thee, and such as
thee, Crabbe pointed not his bitter lines:—</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"But soon a loud and hasty summons calls,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Shakes the thin roof, and echoes round the walls;<br></span>
<span class="i0">Anon a figure enters, quaintly neat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span><br></span>
<span class="i0">All pride and business, bustle and conceit,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With looks unalter'd by these scenes of woe,<br></span>
<span class="i0">With speed that entering speaks his haste to go;<br></span>
<span class="i0">He bids the gazing throng around him fly,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And carries Fate and Physic in his eye;<br></span>
<span class="i0">A potent quack, long versed in human ills,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Who first insults the victim whom he kills,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Whose murd'rous hand a drowsy bench protect,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And whose most tender mercy is neglect.<br></span>
<span class="i0">Paid by the Parish for attendance here,<br></span>
<span class="i0">He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer.<br></span>
<span class="i0">In haste he seeks the bed where misery lies,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Impatience mark'd in his averted eyes;<br></span>
<span class="i0">And, some habitual queries hurried o'er,<br></span>
<span class="i0">Without reply, he rushes to the door;<br></span>
<span class="i0">His drooping patient, long inured to pain,<br></span>
<span class="i0">And long unheeded, knows remonstrance vain;<br></span>
<span class="i0">He ceases now the feeble help to crave<br></span>
<span class="i0">Of man, and mutely hastens to the grave."</span>

the College, who died 11th Nov., 1680, is said, and I am disposed
to think with truth, to have been created a Baronet at
Oxford in 1645. Anthony A. Wood it is true calls him a
'pretended baronet,' but he was acknowledged to be a true
and veritable one by his colleagues of our college, and considering
the jealousy of physicians, which is not quite so
great by the way as you seem to think, this is no small testimony
in favour of my belief. In the 5th edition of Guillim's
Heraldry he is made to be the 450th baronet from the first institution
of the order, and is placed between William de Borcel
of Amsterdam and George Carteret of Jersey. If you think
the matter worthy of investigation you may turn to Nash's
Worcestershire, vol. i., p. 198."</p></div>

England, after Sir Astley, whose superiority of mind
or dexterity of hand stood uncontested, another practitioner
in that category of the Faculty of which it has been said,
'Periculis nostris, et experimenta per mortes agunt medici,'
the once famous St John Long was, I believe, the most
largely requited. I had some previous knowledge of him, and
in 1830 he showed me his pass-book with his bankers, Sir
Claude Scott and Co., displaying a series of credits from
July, 1829, to July, 1830, or a single year's operations, to the
extent of £13,400, But the delusion soon vanished. One act
of liberality on his part at that period, however, I think it
fair to record. To a gentleman who had rendered him
some literary aid, which his defective education made indispensable,
he presented double, not only what he was assured
would be an ample remuneration, but what exceeded fourfold
the sum his friend would have been satisfied with, or had
expected."</p></div>

written by Dr. Jenner, showing as it does the excess of caution
with which he prepared his patients for the trifling operation
of vaccination.
</p>

<blockquote><p>
"Sir,<br>
</p>
<p>
"I was absent from home when your obliging letter of
the 24th November arrived; but I do not think this is likely
to occur again for some time, and I shall therefore be very
happy to take your little family under my care at the time you
mention—the latter end of January. Our arrangements must
be carefully made, as the children must be met here by proper
subjects for transferring the Vaccine Lymph; for on the accuracy
of this part of the process much depends. It may be
necessary to observe also, that among the greatest impediments
to vaccination (indeed the greatest) is an eruptive state
of the skin on the child intended to receive the infection. On
this subject I wrote a paper so long ago as the year 1804, and
took much pains to circulate it; but I am sorry to say the
attention that has been paid to it by the Faculty in general
has been by no means equal to its importance. This is a rock
on which vaccination has been often wreck'd; but there is
no excuse, as it was so clearly laid down in the chart.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
